This is a repository with the data and page generation script for the seminars page.

Alina Russkikh and George Moroz discussed the idea. George Moroz parsed data from the website into the `data.xlsx`. Asya Alekseeva fixed the parsing problems in `data.xlsx`. George Moroz wrote a page generation code.

In order to generate pages

1) update the `data.xlsx` file; 
2) run the `code.R` script.
