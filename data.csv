We are interested in contact situations where Russian is either the source or the target language. First, we will discuss the influence of Russian on neighbouring languages, particularly instances of code-switching and borrowings. We will elaborate on corpus-based case studies of Russian conjunctions, which interact with the local system of clause combining. Second, we will present our projects on non-standard varieties of Russian (mainly those used by the speakers of different Uralic languages, with some parallels drawn from the study of Russian speech in Kyrgyzstan and preliminary typological observations). In addition to the evidence from participant observation, they involve data from the corpus specifically designed to annotate contact-induced features. The main principles of the development of such a corpus will be summarized. Selected corpus-based case studies will be presented (e.g. prepositional phrases in the Russian variety used by Nganasan speakers)."

Однако высокая вариативность темпа речи, слоговых и ритмических факторов затрудняют анализ этого признака в типологической перспективе. Для учета этих факторов и построения динамической модели длительности гласных в Институте филологии СО РАН ведется сбор фонетического материала по тюркским и финно-угорским идиомам Сибири. Комплексный подход предполагает использование экспериментально-фонетических методик, а также сбор соматических данных с помощью УЗИ и МРТ.

2025,4,1,"Oxana Goncharova (Pyatigorsk State University)","Emotion Recognition in Bilingual Speech: A Comprehensive Deep Learning-Based Method","This study explores emotion recognition in bilingual speech through a comparative analysis of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Initially, a hybrid framework was implemented, combining Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) with prosodic features (e.g., pitch, intensity, speech rate) and conventional ML algorithms. While preliminary results were encouraging, the approach suffered from overfitting and limited robustness to minor data variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a deep learning architecture that integrates a CNN-based autoencoder with an embedding network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate a significant enhancement in performance metrics compared to traditional methods, highlighting the potential of multimodal frameworks for emotion analysis in bilingual speech.

Therefore, the talk will be divided into two parts.
 
First, I will discuss the biabsolutive construction in Khwarshi. In this construction both arguments of a transitive verb are marked by the absolutive case, and the verb form is restricted to (periphrastic) progressive. I will discuss some of its properties, including ones that were not discussed before (e.g. its behavior in an embedded clause). I will also show that some speakers allow forming an absolutive construction not only with a progressive form, but also with a resultative one, though in this case some additional restrictions seem to hold.

Second, I will discuss some findings about information structure in Khwarshi. This topic was investigated mostly based on question-answer tasks and tasks involving picture description. I will show that different word orders can be used to mark focus in Khwarshi, including insertion of the focused constituent inside a periphrastic verb form and inversion of lexical verb and auxiliary."

2025,3,11,"Masha Volina (HSE University)","Demonstrative Pronouns in Khwarshi","The Khwarshi language (Nakh-Daghestanian) has a rich system of demonstrative pronouns. Three series of demonstratives can be distinguished: žu — idu, o-CL-žu — a-CL-du and hobo-žu — hobo-du. Each series includes proximal and distal pronouns (which can be used both attributively and substantively), a demonstrative adjective with a meaning close to such and several adverbs. Pronouns from all three series can function deictically and anaphorically, although there is a 'primarily anaphoric' series žu — idu and a 'primarily deictic' series o-CL-žu — a-CL-du. Also, the paradigmatic structure of the Khwarshi demonstrative system is quite complex.
 
In this talk, mainly based on my fieldwork data, I will describe the morphological structure of Khwarshi demonstratives, and the syntactic differences in their usage (mostly outlined in 'A language for Guinness World Records: Fifteen (or more?) reflexive pronouns in Khwarshi' by Yakov Testelets). I will also briefly discuss spatial and discursive factors that influence the choice of a deictic, as well as my hypotheses regarding the differences in their semantics and, accordingly, their functions."
2025,3,4,"Timofey Mukhin (HSE University, University of Liège), Michael Daniel (University of Tübingen)","From space to anaphora: there and back again","In this talk, we consider the anaphoric uses of demonstratives in Mehweb Dargwa. The main goal is to explore how the primary spatial deictic meaning of demonstratives is refracted in the textual - anaphoric - dimension.

We found that the choice of the demonstratives cannot be fully explained in terms of discourse dimensions such as anaphoric distance (Givón 1983). In narrative uses of elevational demonstratives, the center relative to which the referent's position is determined shifts as compared to its deictic uses. In deictic uses of the elevational demonstratives, the deictic center is primarily associated with the speaker. In their anaphoric uses, the elevation value is calculated wrt the most topical/activated referent. 

We suggest that the deictic uses of demonstratives defined by spatial relation with the deictic center do not fully convert into the textual dimension of anaphora when the same demonstratives are used in narratives. While this is easily seen with elevational demonstratives, the question remains whether the same factor is not present in elevation-neuter demonstratives in Mehweb and cross-linguistically, where researchers attempt to provide a full account of their use in purely anaphoric terms."
2025,2,25,"Lena Mironova (HSE University), Yury Lander (HSE University), Shamset Unarokova (Adyghe State University)","One or two approaches to West Caucasian demonstratives","In this talk, we discuss the demonstrative systems in (Temirgoi) West Circassian and (Ashkharawa) Abaza, which represent two branches of the West Caucasian family. Our data come from an experiment based on the questionnaire (Wilkins 2018), which helps to establish the parameters that affect the choice of a demonstrative in its exophoric non-contrastive function.
Both West Circassian and Abaza languages have tripartite demonstrative systems. Our data show the relevance of both the distance parameter and the speaker- or addressee-anchoring parameter, as well as the parameter of visibility, the presence of spatial boundaries and the presence of gestures. However, there are significant differences between the systems of the two languages. We will present our experimental results, describe the meanings of each demonstrative, outline the structural differences between the systems, and suggest some generalizations.
Finally, we will discuss two possible interpretations of our data: it remains to be determined whether these treatments are complementary or whether they should be strictly differentiated.

2025,2,18,Maksim Stepanyants (HSE University),"An attempt at a comprehensive description of Modern Eastern Armenian additive marker ēl","Modern Eastern Armenian (MEA) discourse markers have been generally neglected in the typological literature. However, there is one that has been included in the sample of Forker's (2016) influential paper on additives' polysemy, namely, ēl (էլ). A closer look at the semantics and morphosyntactic properties of this exponent reveals its broad polysemy, which can contribute to the theory of additive markers, cf. also (Gast & van der Auwera 2013. Its diachronic development also needs to be addressed: it presents a case of divergent development of multiple specialized markers (with different morphosyntactic properties) from a conceivable common source, possibly affected by areal influence. The marker ēl is special among other MEA focus markers (cf. Giorgi & Haroutyunian 2016) due to its almost unique enclitic status. In this talk an attempt will be made to address all these issues in a wholistic typologically-anchored approach."
2025,2,11,"Masha Krivolap, Maksim Melenchenko (HSE University)","Predicting Shughni gender with machine learning","Our study aims to investigate the influence of various factors of gender assignment in the Shughni language (Eastern Iranian) using machine learning. We have trained several models to predict grammatical gender (feminine or masculine) on a dataset of 2,390 nouns from the Shughni-Russian dictionary. For training, we used both semantic features (semantic classes and vectorized Russian definitions) and formal features (word endings and the last vowel of the stem). Our results show that semantics plays a primary role in gender assignment in Shughni, as the proposed semantic features can correctly predict the gender for ≈80% of nouns in our sample. Formal features seem less significant and can correctly predict the gender for only ≈70% of nouns in the dataset. The correlation between these two types of gender predictors is high (especially for feminine gender), so combining them does not yield significantly better results."
2025,2,4,Ivan Olkhov (HSE University),"Gender agreement slots in East Caucasian verbs: An areal-typological study and a case study of Andic","In this talk I will discuss the findings of two studies of gender agreement on verbs in East Caucasian languages. In most languages within this language family, gender agreement on verbs is sporadic, meaning that some verb lexemes have an agreement slot in the root while others do not. The first part of my talk will focus on a typological investigation of sporadic agreement on verbs across the East Caucasian family, which was done for a chapter of the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan. I will provide information on the number of agreeing lexemes for those languages where such data are available. These numbers vary significantly, with some languages like Rutul and Tsakhur having agreement on all verbs, while others like Agul and Lezgian have none. Additionally, I will explore the possible positions of non-root agreement slots. The second part of my presentation will delve into a case study of the Andic branch. I will examine verbs with the same meanings in languages within the sample; for each meaning I check in how many languages it is expressed by agreeing verbs and in how many languages these verbs are cognate. By analyzing this data, we can draw conclusions about how the verb agreement slots in Andic are preserved."
2025,1,28,Alexander Letuchiy (HSE University),"Abaza masdars: what regulates the choice of marking?","In this talk, I focus on the types and properties of masdars (nominalizations) in Abaza (a language of the West Caucasian family spoken in Russia). A special feature of Abaza is that it has one marker of masdar (the suffix -ra) – however, masdars themselves fall into several types, based on the person marking. Masdars can inherit the argument marking from the verb (the polypersonal agreement with A and DO of transitive verbs, as well as S and IO of intransitive verbs), show possessive agreement with the argument of the masdar, take a definiteness marker a- or remain unmarked in the prefixal part. In this case, the Abaza system of masdars is rich and poor at the same time.

Each type of masdar marking is in a sense a separate complementation strategy. The four strategies are not freely combined with any matrix verb, but chosen according to semantics of the matrix verb (especially reality- and modality-related properties) and syntactic properties of the construction. Although Abaza has no canonical control structures, some features of masdar constructions are reminiscent of control / restructuring phenomena.

The existence of several masdar types are compatible with the fact that nominalizations, including masdars in Caucasian languages, occupy an intermediate place in the system: on the one hand, they denote a situation and inherit many verbal properties; on the other hand, they get some nominal properties. However, very often, as in English or Arabic, it is the syntactic construction with a nominalization that shows similarities with verbal vs. nominal constructions. In Abaza, this intermediate nature of nominalization is manifested in morphology.

The data, considered in the talk, are collected during fieldwork organized by the HSE University in 2024."
2025,1,21,Elena Shvedova (HSE University),Lability drift in Neo-Aramaic languages,"In this talk, I examine labile verbs in Neo-Aramaic languages (< Semitic), focusing on diachrony and semantics. Labile verbs, which can be used both transitively and intransitively without morphological change, are widespread in Modern Aramaic languages, in contrast to earlier Aramaic varieties where anticausative or causative marking was more prevalent. The verbal system of Christian Urmi (< North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic) can illustrate this expansion of lability: I analyzed 1811 verbs from the dictionary (Khan 2016) and at least 172 of them are labile.

Neo-Aramaic languages can be divided into two main genealogical groups: Eastern and Western Aramaic, which separated during the first millennium BC. In my study I use data from both branches. I categorize Neo-Aramaic labile verbs into three groups based on their historical development: (1) verbs such as ‘freeze’, ‘fill’, and ‘begin’, which retain lability from earlier stages of Aramaic; (2) verbs such as ‘open’, ‘break’, and ‘close’, which transitioned from anticausative marking in Middle Aramaic to lability in Modern Aramaic, reflecting parallel development in Eastern and Western varieties; and (3) verbs unique to Modern Western Aramaic (MWA), including ‘boil’, ‘dry’, and ‘wake up’. In other Middle and Modern Aramaic languages the meanings from the third group are expressed by causatively marked pairs, so the lability of these verbs in MWA represents a morphological innovation.

I will also propose some explanations for the lability drift in Neo-Aramaic languages of different branches, such as the phonetic loss of the anticausative marker, the expansion of verbs with four root consonants that cannot be causativized, and possible areal factors. The study is still a work in progress, so I would like to discuss some future plans, including the research of corpus data from historical texts and modern corpora to trace the development of labile verbs in more detail."
2024,12,17,Rita Popova (Saarland University),Where have all the humans gone? Gender assignment of human nouns in Bantu,"The Bantu languages (Atlantic-Congo), a group of 400–500 varieties, are spoken on the southern part of the African continent, from Nigeria and Cameroon in the west, to the Kenyan coast in the east, and South Africa in the south. These languages are known for their grammatical gender (or noun class) systems, where nouns are categorized into as many as 19 classes that govern agreement in verbs, nominal modifiers, and other targets (Maho 1999).
Unlike the gender systems in Indo-European languages, Bantu noun classes are not based on the sex distinction. Instead, the primary semantic contrast in Bantu gender systems lies between humans and non-humans. In a typical Bantu gender system, most nouns referring to humans are assigned to a single 'human' gender value (traditionally labelled as Gender 1/2 in Bantuist notation). In contrast, non-human nouns are distributed across several other gender values, often according to principles that are highly opaque (Corbett 1991, Katamba 2003). Occasionally, nouns denoting humans with unusual characteristics are found in gender values other than 1/2 (Van de Velde 2019). However, the gender assignment of human nouns has not been systematically investigated, and most of the widely accepted generalizations are derived from observations on a few well-studied Bantu languages.
In this talk, I will demonstrate that gender assignment of human nouns is a parameter of intra-Bantu variation. My study is based on the investigation of more than 30 Bantu lexicons available at the RefLex database (Segerer & Flavier, 2011-2023).
I will show that while some Bantu languages assign most human nouns to Gender 1/2, others have a significant number of human nouns in gender values other than 1/2. In fact, some languages seem to assign most human nouns outside 1/2, 'scattering' them across other gender values. Languages of my sample that exhibit this latter pattern come from the North-Western Bantu region, a zone traditionally recognized as the most diverse within the otherwise relatively homogenous Bantu-speaking world (Nurse & Philippson 2003, p. 165).
I will argue that systems where human nouns are dispersed over different gender values challenge the traditional typological account of nominal classification. According to this view, human nouns — being the semantic core of any nominal classification system — are expected to consistently follow transparent semantic rules of gender assignment (Corbett 1991)."
2024,12,10,Martin Haspelmath (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology),Language parameters and construction parameters in the CrossGram database collection,"Replicability of research results minimally relies on data accessibility, but the data should ideally be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. For technical interoperability, the CLDF standard (Forkel et al. 2018) could be used by typologists, though uptake seems to have been slow so far. In this presentation, I discuss the design of the CrossGram database collection, which is specifically designed for typological datasets (it has been public since the summer of 2024: https://crossgram.clld.org/), Here I describe how CrossGram enhances findability and reusability, and I highlight the two different data types that it supports (language parameters and construction parameters).
     CrossGram makes typological data more findable in that it “brings to light” what is often “hidden away” in supplementary spreadsheet files (or even tables in PDF files, though this is becoming rare). Research papers typically limit themselves to summary tables or graphs and a few small maps, but ideally we want to access all typological datasets with the amenities known from CLLD applications such as WALS Online (Dryer & Haspelmath 2013, wals.info) or Grambank (Skirgård et al. 2023, grambank.clld.org). These provide not only easy exporting in CLDF format, but also easy searching and sorting in data tables, as well as map visualization, and links to references and Glottolog language information.
     In addition, CrossGram provides glossed example sentences in tabular form, similar to the thousands of examples in the APiCS database (Michaelis et al. 2013). These are a particularly striking case of increased transparency, because it is not uncommon for example sentences to be hidden in PDF supplements (for example, Bugaeva 2022 has a supplement of 80 pages of annotated examples). Interlinear glossed text has a range of applications even independently of the typological claims that the examples illustrate, so this is another obvious improvement in reusability.
     CrossGram supports two types of typological data: Language parameters that classify entire languages (i.e. parameters of the type known from the maps of WALS and Grambank), and construction parameters that classify constructions. There are many grammatical meanings or functions that can be rendered by multiple constructions in a given language, and if we only consider language parameters, the language must be classified as “mixed” (or a minor construction must be ignored). For example, Kashmiri has both correlative relative clauses and postnominal relative clauses, so both of these strategies could be included in the database and their properties recorded. Stereotypically, typology consists in classifying languages into types, but in reality, languages often have multiple types coexisting with each other, so the addition of constructions and construction types as a data type makes typological databases more fine-grained.
     Finally, CrossGram parameters (both language parameters and construction parameters) are not only explained succinctly and clearly, but there is also a sophisticated keyword annotation that allows users to easily find grammatical information on a wide range of topics, and for the future, integration with the envisaged “Grammaticon” reference catalogue is planned (see Haspelmath 2022). This will enhance findability and accessibility even further, and it will facilitate replication and (more generally) cumulative science."
2024,12,3,"Daria Ryzhova (HSE University), Polina Padalka (HSE University)",YES and NO answers and their synonyms in Shughni,"Shughni response particles ůn 'yes' and nāy 'no' may be used in various contexts, including, besides answers to polarity questions, reactions to requests, suggestions, opinions and other types of speech acts. In addition to their usage in a dialogue setting, these particles can function as discourse markers in narratives. In this talk, we will outline the range of their functions and present their synonyms: other response particles (e.g. en 'yes', an 'yes', nāyo 'no', na-a 'no') and multiword expressions (discourse formulae). We will show that synonymous items tend to distribute across different discourse functions. For some items, we will trace their presumable pragmaticalization paths."
2024,11,26,Leah Finkelberg (HSE University),Reading group: Cormac Anderson et al. (2023) Variation in phoneme inventories: quantifying the problem and improving comparability,"For over a century, the phoneme has played a central role in linguistic research. In recent years, collections of phoneme inventories, originally designed for cross-linguistic purposes, have increasingly been used in comparative studies involving neighbouring disciplines. Despite the extended application of this type of data, there has been no research into its comparability or tests of its reliability. In this study, we carry out a systematic comparison of nine popular phoneme inventory collections. We render them comparable by linking them to standardised formats for the handling of cross-linguistic datasets, develop new measures to test both size and similarity, and release the organised data in supplementary material. We find considerable differences in inventories supposedly representing the same language variety, both in terms of size and transcriptional choices. While some of these differences appear to be predictable, reflecting design decisions in the different collections, much of the observed variation is unsystematic. These results should sound a note of caution for comparative studies based on phoneme inventories, which we suggest need to take the question of comparability more seriously. We make a number of proposals for improving the comparability of phoneme inventories."
2024,11,19,"Nina Dobrushina (Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage, CNRS, Lyon), Chiara Naccarato (HSE University) and Samira Verhees (independent researcher)",Discourse in contact: an areal study of wish formulas in Daghestan,"Research in the domain of language contact and areal studies so far has focussed on the diffusion of lexical, phonological and grammatical elements, and to a smaller extent --- lexical semantics (Koptjevskaja-Tamm et al. 2022). Much less is known about the spread of discourse forms, although the mechanisms through which discourse units spread are presumably different from that characterizing the lexicon, phonology and grammar. In this talk, we will look at the diffusion of three discourse formulas across the East Caucasus (46 languages from four families), using elicitation, grammars and dictionaries as source: commemorative formulas, farewell wishes and morning greetings. We look at instances of pattern and matter copying across the languages of the East Caucasus, and analyze their areal distribution. The case studies show that the formulas are diverse (there is great variation across the area), and that both matter and pattern copying are abundant. Some formulas cover very large areas and cross genetic boundaries. In all cases the same spread zones influenced by large lingua francas --- Avar (in Central Daghestan) and Azerbaijani (in South Daghestan) --- were attested. The distribution of discourse formulas thus shows a very strong areal signal; we cannot come up with any phonological or grammatical phenomena which are spread in the East Caucasus to the same extent. However, there is also evidence of inheritance, especially for those languages that are spoken outside their genealogical area."
2024,11,12,Alina Russkikh (HSE University),Adnominal Possessive Constructions in Christian Urmi (Neo-Aramaic) from a Typological Perspective,"The Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) varieties are a group of dialects or closely related languages of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. This study aims to distinguish the inventory of adnominal possessive constructions and to describe the formal and syntactic properties of each construction in a particular variety of NENA, the Christian Urmi, from a typological perspective. Data were collected in the village of Urmiya, Krasnodar Region (Russia) and in Verin Dvin, Ararat Province (Armenia) during field trips in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The presentation will also focus on the locus of marking in adnominal possessive constructions and its evolution. Based on the applied syntactic tests, I will propose the new interpretation of the basic construction with the particle ət attached to the head, analyzing its type of marking as detached rather than head marking."
2024,11,5,Konstantin Filatov (HSE University),Reading group: Alexandre François (2014) Trees waves and linkages: Models of language diversification,"Contrary to widespread belief, there is no reason to think that language diversification typically follows a tree-like pattern, consisting of a nested series of neat splits. Except for the odd case of language isolation or swift migration and dispersal, the normal situation is for language change to involve multiple events of diffusion across mutually intelligible idiolects in a network, typically distributed into conflicting isoglosses. Insofar as these events of language-internal diffusion are later reflected in descendant languages, the sort of language family they define - a ""linkage"" (Ross 1988) - is one in which genealogical relations cannot be represented by a tree, but only by a diagram in which subgroups intersect. Non-cladistic models are needed to represent language genealogy, in ways that take into account the common case of linkages and intersecting subgroups. This paper will focus on an approach that combines the precision of the Comparative Method with the realism of the Wave Model. This method, labeled Historical Glottometry, identifies genealogical subgroups in a linkage situation, and assesses their relative strengths based on the distribution of innovations among modern languages. Provided it is applied with the rigour inherent to the Comparative Method, Historical Glottometry should help unravel the genealogical structures of the world's language families, by acknowledging the role played by linguistic convergence and diffusion in the historical processes of language diversification."

As this is a work in progress, I am also going to discuss some challenges I am facing while working on this topic."
2024,10,22,Alexander Rostovtsev-Popiel (Mainz University),Suppletion and Selective Restrictions in the Kartvelian Verb,"This talk is about suppletion and selectional restrictions in the Kartvelian verb. This phenomenon, albeit well-known and widely acknowledged, has never been subject to a dedicated study. Suppletion in Kartvelian has a number of facets that are distributed among a number of diverse domains of linguistic structure, viz. morphology, morphosyntax, semantics, and social deixis, as well as cross-sections thereof. This talk thus aims to provide a concise overview on the patterns found in Kartvelian and categorize them in scalar format."
2024,10,15,"Akhmed Dugrichilov, Taisia Trenikhina, Maksim Melenchenko (HSE University)",The typological database of vigesimal numeral systems,"In our talk, we present the typological database of vigesimal (base-‘20’) numeral systems in languages of the world, which is currently in development. First, we discuss some theoretical problems of numeral systems, the solutions implemented in existing typological databases (WALS and Grambank) and their shortcomings. Then we describe the details of our approach and the preliminary results of the project. We have created a sample of 256 languages which are claimed to have vigesimal systems by Grambank or WALS and annotated 73 so far, focusing on two linguistic areas with high concentration of base ‘20’: Mesoamerica and Papunesia. We show that the distribution of types of numeral systems differs significantly from the one presented by the Grambank data. This is caused not only by annotation mistakes in Grambank but also by the application of a more strict methodology in our study."

Additionally, we will present two case studies that utilize this resource. The first case study assesses the stability of dialects using the database alongside dialect corpora, focusing on the dialect vocabulary spoken in a set of villages in the Zapadnodvinsky district of the Tver region. The second is devoted to the classification of Russian dialects using dialectometric methods, specifically multidimensional scaling (MDS). This study draws on data from the Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language in its entirety, offering four classifications based on individual linguistic levels—morphology, phonetics, syntax, and lexis—as well as a comprehensive classification that accounts for all linguistic features reflected in the atlas. The primary focus of the study will be on distinguishing the differences between eastern and western Russian dialects based on the database materials, as well as offering a historical interpretation of this dialect division."
2024,10,1,Yury Lander (HSE University),Differential argument (un)marking: A new survey of alignment in West Circassian,"West Circassian, also erroneously known as Adyghe, is usually characterized in literature as showing ergative alignment in morphology and possibly even in syntax (Gishev 1985; Kumakhov et al. 1996; Kumakhov & Vamling 2006; Kumakhov & Vamling 2009; Lander 2010; Letuchiy 2012; Ershova 2019 inter alia). In this talk I will show that if we consider differential argument marking (see, e.g., Arkadiev & Testelets 2019) and certain syntactic properties of nominals (such as those discussed in Arkadiev et al. 2009; Lander et al. 2021), the actual situation turns out to be much more complex. No novel data will be provided for scholars of Circassian languages, but I am going to discuss various kinds of pressure in the West Circassian alignment system and the related issues (including the distinction between the “canonical” differential object marking and incorporating processes and the alignment preferences displayed by different kinds of nominals)."
2024,9,24,Irina Politova (HSE University),Reading group: Peter W. Smith et al. (2019) Case and number suppletion in pronouns,"Suppletion for case and number in pronominal paradigms shows robust patterns across a large, cross-linguistic survey. These patterns are largely, but not entirely, parallel to patterns described in Bobaljik (2012) for suppletion for adjectival degree. Like adjectival degree suppletion along the dimension positive < comparative < superlative, if some element undergoes suppletion for a category X, that element will also undergo suppletion for any category more marked than X on independently established markedness hierarchies for case and number. We argue that the structural account of adjectival suppletive patterns in Bobaljik (2012) extends to pronominal suppletion, on the assumption that case (Caha 2009) and number (Harbour 2011) hierarchies are structurally encoded. In the course of the investigation, we provide evidence against the common view that suppletion obeys a condition of structural (Bobaljik 2012) and/or linear (Embick 2010) adjacency (cf. Merchant 2015; Moskal and Smith 2016), and argue that the full range of facts requires instead a domain-based approach to locality (cf. Moskal 2015b). In the realm of number, suppletion of pronouns behaves as expected, but a handful of examples for suppletion in nouns show a pattern that is initially unexpected, but which is, however, consistent with the overall view if the Number head is also internally structurally complex. Moreover, variation in suppletive patterns for number converges with independent evidence for variation in the internal complexity and markedness of number across languages."

The DiaL2 project was launched two years ago with an aim to study the linguistic variation found in these corpora. We applied a UDpipe morphological and syntactic parser, manually annotated a set of linguistic features (sometimes relistening the recordings in order to check the transcriptions), and implemented statistical models for each feature that predict the probability of divergence from Standard Russian. During the talk we will discuss our results based on several features:

- non-standard marking in numeral constructions (dva dom [two.M house.SG] ‘two houses’);

- preposition drop (rodilas' [v] tridcat' devjatom godu ‘(she) was born (in) nineteen thirty-nine’);

- non-standard marking in negative existential constructions (ranše sadiki ne byli ‘there were no kindergartens before.’). 

As possible predictors in the models, we used sociolinguistic features (gender, year of birth, years of education), measures of collocationality, and some relevant linguistic features. During the work we discovered multiple typos, inconsistent and wrong transcriptions, and corrected a lot of them. Therefore, we started a parallel project dedicated to automatic correction of the Lab’s corpora, which will also be discussed during the talk."
2024,6,25,Peter Arkadiev (Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies),Towards a typology of passive lability with special reference to Abaza,"Uncoded passive alternations, also known as passive lability, are only rarely mentioned and discussed in the typological and theoretical literature on passive and voice, despite their being prominent in some language families (e.g. Mande) and linguistic areas (e.g. Western Africa). In this talk I start by discussing the peculiar objective resultative construction in Abaza, a polysynthetic Northwest Caucasian language, and investigate the degree of its similarity to the cross-linguistic prototype of the passive. Given that the Abaza resultative is morphologically unmarked, I argue that it can be considered an instance of passive lability. Further, I propose a preliminary typology of uncoded passives on the basis of a small convenience sample of examples I could gather from the literature. I’ll try to show that this phenomenon is somewhat more widespread than is usually believed and that its cross-linguistic variation largely fits within the typology of “canonical” morphologically marked passives and complements it."
2024,6,18,Ilia Afanasev (HSE University/MTS AI),A new method for genetic language distance measurement between closely related lects,"Measuring distance between different language varieties (lects) generally must rely on an extensive linguistic research that includes collecting wordlists and information on evolution of the phonetic system (Campbell, 2013). However, sometimes gathering this kind of data seems to be impossible, due to the lack of material, as the only one researchers stay with is a small sample of remaining texts. Most often this is the case of historical small territorial varieties. This eliminates any possibility of a reliable automatic classification, yet still preserves the possibility of a preliminary one.
The talk proposes a new method for measuring language distance between small historical closely-related lects, that is based on the combination of frequency-based methods and string similarity measures, and introduces a corpus-based string similarity measure that intends to imitate more advanced phonetic-based scores. The materials for its evaluations are modern and historical Slavic lects, including Slovak, Slovenian and Croatian standards, Belogornoje, Megra and Zialionka dialects, as well as Novgorod, Smolensk and Polack legal texts of XII – XIV centuries.  The key technique used is cross-evaluation with more traditional dialectometry methods, where it is possible. Python implementation of the methods given is available as a Python package."

Despite the fact that the syllable structure is described in every grammatical description of the Andic languages, in my work I try to get the same result using a database of dictionaries (Moroz et al. 2023). To this data, I applied the LexStat method (List 2012) in order to automatically match cognacy and then used the Levenshtein distance search function for comparing syllabic structures of cognates. As a result of a pairwise comparison of cognates from different languages, the general tendency of the Andic languages to prioritize the CV-syllable. What is more, I came to particular conclusions about the beginning of the word (strict openness of the first syllable in Ahvakh, high tolerance of the closed syllable in Botlikh and Andi) and about the end of the word (mainly open syllable in Ahvakh, closed syllable in Botlikh, Chamalal and Bagvalal). In addition, I have separately examined the processes of reducing consonants r, l, m, n, j, w, b in Andic languages. The results I have obtained are of scientific interest, as they testify to the historical processes in the Andic languages."

‘I want you to steal apples.’
 
Based on the appearance of example (1), we might expect it to mean ‘I want to make you steal apples.’ However, the presence of the causative construction in the embedded clause is not reflected in the semantics, since the sentence in (1) cannot be understood as expressing a want to cause the stealing. Instead, as the translation of (1) shows, the embedded clause is non-controlled, with the locative “causee” understood as the agent of the embedded event. I present an overview of the phenomenon across Dargwa and concentrate on the details of the construction in Standard/Aqusha Dargwa."

We contribute to the extensive body of research by providing a detailed analysis of one type of contexts in which body part terms appear, i.e., non-semiotic bodily movements, such as to cross the hands behind the back, to cover the face with the hands, etc. We find that different languages use different body part terms to describe the same bodily movement. The choice of the term depends on a range of conditions, including the inventory of the available terms, the сhoice of the linguistic construction, and the degree of conventionalisation. We take this as evidence for an additional aspect of the meaning of a body part term, which has been largely ignored in the previous typological literature. This aspect is the set of semantic restrictions on constructions in which the body part term can appear. We argue that it needs to be addressed in order to ensure the exhaustive cross-linguistic description of this semantic domain."
2024,5,14,Maria Ermolova (HSE University),On the genesis of the anti-resultative meaning of the pluperfect in the history of Russian,"As is well known, Russian constructions with the participle было (пошел было, но вернулся) go back to the Old Russian pluperfect with the anti-resultative meaning. Denoting the anti-resultative meaning is one of the main secondary functions of the pluperfect in the languages of the world. V.A. Plungian and D.V. Sitchinava, based on typological data, connect the emergence of the anti-resultative with different pluperfect meanings from the semantic zone of the discontinuous past. However, data from the Russian chronicles, as well as live dialect data, show that the anti-resultative meaning in the history of Russian could develop not from the meaning of the discontinuous past, but from the resultative meaning."
2024,4,23,Anna Golovina and Ksenia Dunaeva (HSE University),Using transducers to create morphological parsers and other NLP tools for Nakh-Daghestanian languages,"Our talk is dedicated to creating morphological parsers for low-resource Nakh-Daghestanian languages.
Morphological parsers can be created based on either processing of a set of grammatical rules of the language or probabilistic models underlying neural networks. The latter are not suitable for languages with a small collection of annotated texts. A finite-state transducer is a rule-based parser that can be defined as a type of finite-state automata with two input tapes. Whereas ordinary finite-state automata can merely determine whether a concrete string belongs to the described regular language, a transducer maps between two sets of symbols: input symbols and output symbols. The transducer makes correspondence between a surface word form and a string with morphological analysis. Building a two-level rule-based parser requires combining a minimum of two different finite-state transducers: one for lexicon storing and morphotactics modeling and another for implementing morphophonological rules.
In recent years, morphological parsers based on transducers were implemented for a wide range of East Caucasian languages, including Tsez (Wilson & Howell, 2022), Andi Proper (Buntiakova 2023) and Zilo Andi (Moroz 2022), Bagvalal (Ignatiev 2022), and some others. Our talk will be focused on building parsers for Avar and Bezhta Proper. We will discuss in detail the tools that can be used to create a morphological transducer, the difficulties that one may encounter while computationally modeling the morphology and morphophonology of Nakh-Daghestanian languages, the projects that are already being implemented at the Higher School of Economics, and the future prospects for using rule-based morphological parsers."
2024,4,16,Konstantin Filatov (HSE University), Reading group: Rik van Gijn & Max Wahlström (2023) Linguistic areas,"Linguistic area research has received ample attention in the last century. Nevertheless, methodology remains somewhat underdeveloped, and there seem to be few, if any, generalizations about the relation between the processes underlying area formation and their outcomes. The main challenge is that, in most cases, the past is not directly accessible and therefore has to be reconstructed. Linguistic area research, therefore, stands to gain immensely from a firm embedding into a framework that includes both other strands of contact linguistics and extra-linguistic disciplines to complete the picture."
2024,4,9,Rita Popova (HSE University) and Michael Daniel (Collegium de Lyon / Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage),Number-conditioned stem alternation in adjectives of size (East Caucasian supplement),"In our previous talk at the Lab, we showed that, across the world, property words denoting size may use different stems depending on the number of the entities they are predicated of; and that, in a cross-linguistic perspective, they do so visibly more often than other property words (Popova and Daniel in prep.; see also Nurmio 2017). This pattern of stem alternation for ‘small’ has also been observed in East Caucasian languages (Yakovlev 1960 on Chechen, Kibrik & Kodzasov 1988 on Lak, Azaev 2000 on Botlikh, Kibrik 1999 on Tsakhur, and arguably Nichols 2011 on Ingush).

Notably, the phenomenon has been reported in areally separated (south, central, northwest) languages belonging to different branches (Lezgic, Lak, Andic and Nakh); but the lexical items involved do not always seem to be cognate. It thus seems another case of a cross-linguistically rare phenomenon that emerged as a result of parallel independent development (cf. Daniel & Maisak 2014 on verificative, Nasledskova & Netkachev, under review on ordinal numerals, Daniel 2017 on “person by other means”). Such phenomena are notoriously challenging for an evolutionary interpretation.

It is not obvious that we deal here with suppletion in number. In the languages under study, number agreement is not necessarily present in adjectives, so that the two forms may not belong to one inflectional paradigm. Instead, we will call this pattern number-driven dislexification (cf. François 2022) in the sense that two meanings, ‘small (of one)’ and ‘small (of many)’, commonly expressed by the same lexical item, are split into two different lexical items (cf. similar approach to verbal number in Durie 1986, Mithun 1988, François 2019). Strikingly, while the phenomenon is attested in individual languages dispersed across different branches, and thus could be suspected of being inherited, the cognacy of the alternating stem is not obvious. In some of these languages ‘small (of many)’ is recruited from ‘fine-grained (of e.g. sand)’ (a component structure adjective in terms of Maiden 2014, Nurmio 2017, who discuss the same path of emergence of number suppletion is discussed). We hypothesized that the development of number dislexification emerged through gradual lexical extension of ‘fine-grained’, from more to less mass-like nouns. To test this claim, we ran an online elicitation test, collecting data from each but two languages of the family, in most cases from several respondents. We investigated lexical preferences for expressing the meaning of ‘small (of many)’, expecting to find cases intermediate between languages that only apply ‘fine grained’ to masses and languages that apply it to all plural nouns. We used similar number contexts for ‘big’ as fillers.

Our expectation was partially borne out. In addition to this, we also had some less expected results. We noticed that the phenomenon of number dislexification has a wider spread than reported in the literature in terms of languages involved. We noticed that, in some languages, the dislexified adjective for ‘small (of many)’ and the adjective for ‘fine-grained’ may be unrelated, at least synchronically. We noticed that, notwithstanding plural reference of the noun, ‘small (of one)’ may be induced by the use of the singular form in NPs modified by a numeral - a switch more expected under a grammatical (suppletion) rather than lexical (dislexification) perspective on the phenomenon. Finally, we discovered the same phenomenon present, even if more rarely, in adjectives for ‘big’, our intended fillers.

We expected that a more nuanced model distinguishing between -- (a) absence of lexical extension of ‘fine-grained’ altogether, (b) presence of such an extension as a preference and (c) a strict dislexification -- complemented by historical analysis of cognacy of the items  could provide a more feasible explanation of the distribution of the phenomenon of number dislexification across the family in genealogical or contact terms. So far, our results are not conclusive in this respect."
2024,4,2,Matthew Sung and Jelena Prokić (Leiden University),Recent Developments in Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Micro-Variation,"Dialectometry is the quantitative branch of dialectology which utilizes computational methods to calculate linguistic distances and generate visualizations which allow us to explore relationships between dialects. Although dialectometry is a growing field with an increasing number of new approaches, some corners in dialectal variation are still rather unexplored. Firstly, dialectometry is a popular method in Europe, but not so much in other parts of the world. It is unclear whether our findings of dialectal variation in Europe (e.g. the existence of a dialect continuum, the specific dynamics of dialect spread) are also found in other corners of the world. Secondly, most of the work on phonetic variation is based on segments, while most of the world’s languages are tonal (Yip 2002). It is unclear how dialects vary on the tonal level. Lastly, the outcome of a dialectometric analysis is usually a classification of dialects, but the features that contribute to this classification, i.e. dialect features which are exclusive to certain groups, are not explored in these classifications. In this talk, we would like to address the issues raised above based on our latest work done in Leiden."
2024,3,26,Irene Gorbunova (Russian State University for the Humanities),Nominal Causal Constructions in Khwarshi Proper,"In this talk I will address the various ways of nominal cause marking in Khwarshi Proper (a dialect of Khwarshi < Tsezic < East Caucasian). The data was collected in Daghestan during several field trips in 2022-2023, the research was based on (but not limited to) the NoCaCoDa project questionnaire. The grammar descriptions of Khwarshi mention the causal case, which seems to be a unique feature of Khwarshi as compared to other (West) Tsezic languages. Even more peculiar is the fact that the causal case in Khwarshi, albeit attested, is not the default option for marking the nominal cause: rather, a designated postposition or spatial case forms are used. Furthermore, the designated postposition, as well as the spatial case most commonly used for cause marking, both show unexpected semantic shifts under certain predicates."

Анализ генетических расстояний между  18 популяциями (N=2216) нахско-дагестанской, алтайской и индоевропейской языковых семей выявляют три компонента генофонда - «степной», «иранский» и «дагестанский» - с разным весом вклада в генофонд и в разные периоды его формирования. «Степной» компонент выражен только у караногайцев и отражает хронологически самую позднюю волну миграций – тюркоязычных кочевников Евразийской степи в средние века. «Иранский» компонент выражен в генофонде азербайджанцев Азербайджана и Дагестана, табасаран Дагестана и всех ираноязычных народов Кавказа. «Дагестанский» компонент преобладает во всех популяциях, говорящих на дагестанских языках (кроме табасаран), и у тюркоязычных кумыков. Каждая компонента связана с определенным комплексом Y-гаплогрупп: «степной» комплекс - C-M217, N-LLY22g, R1b-M73 и R1a-M198; «иранский» комплекс - J2-M172(×M67,M12) и R1b-M269, «дагестанский» комплекс - J1-Y3495. Выдвинута гипотеза, что гаплогруппа J1-Y3495  возникла 6,5±0,6 kya в автохтонной прапопуляции центральной части Дагестана.

2024,3,12,Maksim Melenchenko (HSE University),Reading group: Martin Haspelmath (2023) Inflection and derivation as traditional comparative concepts,"This article revisits the distinction between inflectional and derivational patterns in general grammar and discusses the possibility that this well-known distinction is not rooted in the reality of languages, but in the Western tradition of describing languages, through dictionaries (for words, including derived lexemes) and through grammar books (where we often find tables of exemplary paradigms). This tradition has led to rather different terminological treatments of the two kinds of patterns, but from the perspective of a constructional view of morphology, there is no need to incorporate such differences into formal grammatical descriptions. For practical purposes, we need clear and simple definitions of entrenched terms of general linguistics, so the article proposes semantically based (retro-) definitions of *inflection*, *derivation* and *lexeme* that cover the bulk of the existing usage. Finally, I briefly explain why we need sharp definitions of comparative concepts, and why prototype-based and fuzzy definitions of traditional terms are not helpful."
2024,3,5,John Mansfield (University of Zurich), When social contact promotes diversification,"In much linguistic literature, small, socially isolated speech communities are the main locus of diversification and grammatical complexity (e.g. Trudgill 2011). Similarly, linguistic differentiation is traditionally viewed as resulting from social separation of groups (Paul 1888), while intensive social contact between groups can lead to structural convergence of their languages (e.g. Gumperz & Wilson 1971; Ross 1996). However, sociolinguistic literature shows that social groups in regular contact use language as a way of developing and maintaining distinct group identities (Eckert 2008), and in regions with many small ethnic groups this can drive diversification (François 2011; Evans 2019; Epps 2020), a kind of ‘sympatric speciation’ in linguistic evolution.
In this presentation I consider evidence for contact-driven diversification, paying particular attention to which dimensions of language may be used to index group identity. I present a cross-linguistic database on dialect differentiation, which analyses grammatical variation and dialect differences in 42 languages, drawing on data from reference grammars. The main finding is that grammatical ordering very rarely differentiates dialects in close contact, but the form of grammatical markers (affixes, clitics and function words) frequently *does* differentiate dialects in close contact."
2024,2,27,Silvia Luraghi (University of Pavia) and Chiara Zanchi (University of Pavia),Introducing PaVeDa – The Pavia Verb Database,"PaVeDa – The Pavia Verb Database is the focus of the project “Verbs’ constructional patterns across languages: a multi-dimensional investigation”, a joint enterprise of two teams of researchers from the Universities of Pavia and Naples “Federico II.”  PaVeDa  is an open-source relational database for investigating verb argument structure across languages (Zanchi et al. 2022), intending to expand and enhance the Valency Patterns Leipzig (ValPaL) database (Hartmann et al. 2013), developed within the Leipzig Valency Classes Project, which carried out a large-scale cross-linguistic comparison of valency classes. The project relied on a group of contributors, who collaborated by providing a consistent set of cross-linguistic data. The online database ValPaL contains data from 36 languages, based on a database questionnaire for a selected sample of 80 verb meanings. Apart from valency frames, contributors provided information about possible alternations, both uncoded and coded.

In spite of the research carried out within the ValPaL project, no systematic comparative study on diachronic developments across languages is available. The PaVeDa project intends to expand and enhance the ValPaL database with more languages and further features and is configured to contrastively display valency patterns simultaneously in different languages. Within this project, the Pavia team cooperates with a number of international partners who provide sets of data for the new languages uploaded in the database. For the time being, the datasets from several ancient languages (Old Latin, Ancient Greek, Gothic, Old English, Classical Armenian, Old High German) and modern languages (Modern Greek) have been uploaded in the database, along with the modern languages stored in the ValPaL database. As for the additional features, an intermediate level of annotation to the original ValPal have been added, the alternation class, which categorizes language-specific alternations into four cross-linguistic types (valency re-arranging, valency augmenting, valency decreasing, argument identifying), and serves as the initial comparative tool. While the ValPaL database does not allow for contrastive visualization of constructions across the languages it contains, developers of the PaVeDa database designed a special layer of annotation that allows generalizing over language-specific patterns, and makes them visually comparable. Work on ancient languages also brought to methodology redesign, as ancient languages can only be studied based on corpus data rather than relying on the native speakers’ knowledge. This practice brings about a usage-based methodology that we have started implementing for modern languages too, linking the data on constructional patterns to existing digitalized corpora. In the near future, we aim to further develop both typological and diachronic comparison by adding more languages, both ancient and modern, from language families already represented in the ValPal database (Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic), as well as from families that are not represented (Uralic and Turkic)."

Linguists agree, however, that the concept of dialect is vague and the extent of a dialect is fuzzy. With contact being a crucial driver of linguistic change at sublanguage levels, we attempt to sketch the perspective that contact dialectology and related sub-disciplines can offer on this fuzziness with regard to the spatial variation of dialects and dialect areas. Thus we address contact processes and patterns characterizing individuals, groups, communities, areas and beyond, at temporal scales spanning from mundane contact through generations to deeper time enough for dialects to diverge and disappear."

Our study is based on the BivalTyp questionnaire focusing on 130 two-place predicates (Say 2018). We explore areal and genealogical factors in valency expression. While belonging to two distinct genealogical groupings, two languages of the set, i.e. Mano (Southern Mande) and Kpelle (Southwestern Mande), are in intense contact with one another (Khachaturyan & Konoshenko 2021). We investigate to what extent the synchronic patterning of valency expression in the data can be accounted for by contact and / or inheritance. We found that on the basis of the lexical equivalents for a given predicate, the languages are distributed strictly following the genealogical principle, and Mano clusters together with other Southern Mande languages. Yet the type of construction chosen for a particular predicate, as well as, for intransitive constructions, the postposition introducing the second argument, are subject to areal influence, with Mano clustering together with its Southwestern neighbors, Kpelle and Kono, and not with its closest genealogical Southern Mande relatives, Guro and Dan-Gweetaa. In addition, the structure of complex verbs in Mano resembles more that of Kpelle and Kono than that of Guro and Dan-Gweetaa. Thus, although Mano verbal forms are virtually unaffected by contact, the patterns of valency expression, as well as verbal lexical patterns are strongly influenced by neighboring languages. While this is by far not the only study showing predominance of pattern-borrowing in multilingual settings (Epps 2008; François 2011, inter alia), it showcases argument coding as a useful parameter for a comparative study of both pattern and matter.

Evenki (Tungusic) is spoken in a very large area throughout Siberia and manifests a great dialectal diversity. I consider 10 verbs with variable valency patterns across 15 Evenki dialects. The main data were obtained from two corpora of Evenki, supplementary data come from available descriptions. The cluster analysis of variation in argument encoding shows the following results. Clusters of dialects based on valency patterns do not match with the existing classification of Evenki dialects. At the same time, they correlate much better with their areal distribution and with presence/absence of contact with other languages. This supports the claim that valency patterns are diachronically unstable and tend to be easily borrowed.  "

The study provides an in-depth corpus analysis of more than 15,000 examples, using a logistic regression statistical model to predict the choice between presence and absence of concord. The results indicate concord is most likely to occur in constructions with structurally simple and frequent proper names that exhibit adjectival properties and match the common noun in grammatical gender. Proper names with the Goal semantic role show concord with a higher probability than proper names with other roles. It is proposed that all relevant factors refer to frequency or convenience. A diachronic investigation shows that concord has become a much less preferred option over time. It is argued that concord is of low functional significance and suggest that this may explain the gradual loss of concord over time."

This talk depicts my first attempt at analyzing the collected data and this work is still in progress. My main objective is to determine in which contexts the spatial meanings of case, adverb/postposition and verbal prefix are different and what aspects of topological relations each of these elements relate to."

There have been various attempts to find a common definition for both uses, but I will argue in this paper that they all have problems with (a) ruling out unacceptable interpretations, or (b) accounting for the contrary-to-fact implicature of counterfactual conditionals, or (c) predicting the observed cross-linguistic variation, or a combination thereof. By combining insights from two basic lines of reasoning, I will propose a simple and transparent approach that solves all the observed problems and offers a new understanding of the concept of counterfactuality."

Quechua is no exception to this phenomenon. The restrictive marker =lla is attested in all Quechuan idioms (surfacing in slightly different phonetic shape). My talk addresses the variety of its uses mostly in Ecuadorian Quechua (or Kichwa) and elaborates on two main features of interest. Firstly, =lla exhibits a surprisingly wide polysemy in non-nominal domain, ranging from diminutive to focus-contrastive uses. Secondly, it displays a unique morphosyntactic behavior that suggests an intermediate status between a mesoclitic and an affix. I will present the main facts and discuss possible ways of accounting for these intriguing properties.

The data representing morphological complexity are systems of locative forms of nouns in 33 lects of the Dargwa language group (Nakh-Dagestanian). As a simple correlate of the complexity parameter, we used the number of locative series, the number of nominal forms in each series and the total number of locative forms.

The geographical characteristics to be checked is the accessibility of the villages where these lects are spoken. We used several estimates of inaccessibility like height above sea level, distance from the administrative center, and a complex parameter that takes into account several characteristics.

The results are moderately positive: the correlation in question exists, but its interpretation is not obvious and requires a serious discussion."

Here we present an extensive database of Indo-European core vocabulary that eliminates past inconsistencies in cognate coding. Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of ~8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with recently published ancient DNA evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent. "

While the causative marking has been stable and productive in these idioms for several millennia, the anticausative coding has undergone dramatic changes. It was very common in Old and Middle Aramaic, but has been completely lost in most Modern Aramaic varieties due to phonetic assimilation or for other as-yet unidentified reasons. In my study, after defining the class of the verbal concepts that were typically coded with anticausative marker in Old and Middle Aramaic, I explore how these meanings are expressed in Neo-Aramaic. The data shows that the large class of Neo-Aramaic labile verbs can be separated into two groups: those that have been labile since the first millennium BCE and those whose lability is a novel Neo-Aramaic trait that has replaced anticausative marking.

All four depend crucially on discourse context. Although topic and focus are sometimes viewed as complementary relations, they belong to distinct dimensions of information structure, with one (focus) having to do with the locus of new information in an utterance, and the other (topic) with the entity that the utterance is about.  The following questions are specified in the article:

What is the nature of the relation?

How is it marked cross-linguistically?

How can it be elicited and documented?

Variation is attested in all corpora, but to different extents (it is higher in Daghestan as compared to corpora from other regions), and generally much lower as compared to results obtained for other varieties of bilinguals' Russian (cf. Stoynova 2021 on Nanai and Ulcha Russian). The attested variation can only partly be explained as the result of pattern borrowing from the speakers' L1s, and correlations with the type of numeral involved (higher variation with paucals and collectives) would point to incomplete or non-standard L2 learning as a more viable hypothesis. For most of the corpora, variation seems to characterize the speech of few speakers-outliers, so we cannot extrapolate our conclusions to the whole population."

While Preterite denotes witnessed events, Perfect is used for non-witnessed events (for example, reported by other people or inferred). It is also used in experiential (such as ‘I have never…’) and counterfactual contexts. For a closed set of verbs that denote states, the Perfect form serves as a progressive present tense (e.g. ‘I am sitting’). In narratives, Perfect is generally for introductory or backgrounding events. The Perfect form of the Shughni verb ‘to be’ вуδҷ can refer to present-tense situations that are witnessed by the speaker. Similar forms in other languages have been dubbed “mirative”; I will attempt to argue against such a label for Shughni.

Elicitation and Documentation of Tense and Aspect,"All languages seem to have provisions for the representation of time in their lexicons and discourse structures. But evidence has been mounting in recent years that the ways in which the representation of time is inscribed into the grammars of different languages varies substantially. This article reviews this evidence and introduces some empirical and analytical tools that facilitate the study of tense-mood-aspect systems in the field. The article begins by laying out some basics of temporal semantics (following Klein 1994 and Bohnemeyer 2014) and surveying tools and methods for the study of temporal semantics in the field. It then zeroes in on the topic of tenselessness. After reviewing the empirical case for tenselessness in one language, Yucatec Maya (Bohnemeyer 2002, 2009), four recent field-based studies of future-time reference (FTR) in (superficially or profoundly) tenseless languages are compared: Yucatec, Kalaallisut (Bittner 2005), St’át’imcets (Matthewson 2006), and Paraguayan Guaraní (Tonhauser 2011). Tenseless languages often grammaticalize a distinction between reference to factual and non-factual situations, treating FTR as non-factual. Past counterfactuals can serve as a diagnostic context, as they permit non-future tenses, but not irrealis markers."

2023,6,27,Vera Tsukanova (University of Marburg),Areal factors in nominal plural formation in Semitic languages,"The Semitic languages have different strategies of forming nominal plurals. In some languages, only suffixes are used, while in others, suffixation or transfixation (“broken plural”) depending on the lexical item. The first group also includes languages  where several nouns can undergo apophonic alternations in the plural; and the second group includes some languages where suffixes and transfixes can apply to the same lexical item at the same time. For a long time, the presence of the “broken plural” was considered to be an important isogloss which separates South Semitic from the rest of the Semitic languages. Recently this classification has, however, been revised, and the “broken plural” has been reinterpreted as an areal phenomenon. Departing from this, I am going to address the role of areal factors in the shaping of the traditional phylogenetic configurations of the Semitic languages."

Their semantic contribution to the meaning of the sentence is the presupposition that there is at least one true alternative to the focussed constituent. Another, less common type of focus particles are intensifying particles, such as Avar =*go* (Forker 2015). The core function of such particles is contrast or emphasis marking.  In some languages, besides their core functions, additive and intensifying particles also occur in other, peripheral functions. Interestingly, in some of these functions both types of particles are used. The purpose of this talk is to establish a list of “shared” functions where both types of particles can be used, and compare the distribution of additive and intensifying particles across the shared functions. Our sample thus includes languages that feature both additive and intensifying particles. Besides, we limit ourselves to clitics.

By the evolution of the old temporal system the PPP tends to grammaticalize and transform into a special form which has the preterit meaning and doesn’t need indication on the action’s subject.

An array of different data sets have been used to investigate the genealogical relationships between them, but the controversy persists. The new data with a high potential for such cases in historical linguistics are structural features, which are sometimes declared to be prone to borrowing and discarded from the very beginning and at other times considered to have an especially precise historical signal reaching further back in time than other types of linguistic data. We investigate the performance of typological features across different domains of language by using an admixture model from genetics. As implemented in the software STRUCTURE, this model allows us to account for both a genealogical and an areal signal in the data. Our analysis shows that morphological features have the strongest genea- logical signal and syntactic features diffuse most easily. When using only morphological structural data, the model is able to correctly identify three language families: Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, whereas Japonic and Koreanic languages are assigned the same ancestry."

The majority of borrowings are nouns and adjectives, whereas verbs are borrowed the least. When verbs are borrowed, they are adapted by using different integration strategies, which are light verb strategy, indirect insertion, and direct insertion [Wohlgemuth, 2009].

In this talk, I will present verbal adaptation strategies found in the languages of Daghestan.  For instance, languages in contact with Avar integrate verbal borrowings using light verb strategy and indirect insertion. Languages in contact with Turkic languages use light verb strategy and direct insertion. It is generally the case that a recipient language has one strategy for integrating verbs from various donor languages, e.g., Bezhta uses light verb strategy to integrate Avar, Georgian, and Russian verbs. Other languages apply one integration strategy per donor language, e.g., Khwarshi uses light verb strategy for Russian verbs and indirect insertion for Avar verbs. Few languages combine two strategies for one donor language, e.g., Lezgian uses light verb strategy and direct insertion for adapting Russian verbs.  "

Direct and indirect evidence of compression of word lengths. Zipf's law of abbreviation revisited. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.10128.  ","Zipf’s law of abbreviation, the tendency of more frequent words to be shorter, is one of the most solid candidates for a linguistic universal, in the sense that it has the potential for being exceptionless or with a number of exceptions that is vanishingly small compared to the number of languages on Earth. Since Zipf’s pioneering research, this law has been viewed as a manifestation of a universal principle of communication, i.e. the minimization of word lengths, to reduce the effort of communication. Here we revisit the concordance of written language with the law of abbreviation. Crucially, we provide wider evidence that the law holds also in speech (when word length is measured in time), in particular in 46 languages from 14 linguistic families. Agreement with the law of abbreviation provides indirect evidence of compression of languages via the theoretical argument that the law of abbreviation is a prediction of optimal coding. Motivated by the need of direct evidence of compression, we derive a simple formula for a random baseline indicating that word lengths are systematically below chance, across linguistic families and writing systems, and independently of the unit of measurement (length in characters or duration in time). Our work paves the way to measure and compare the degree of optimality of word lengths in languages."

My main evidence came from Modern Eastern Armenian, where, additionally, a nice morphosyntactic correlation is observed: temporally mobile forms of indicative (as perfect, prospective, and durative) tend to be periphrastic, while temporally stable forms (as aorist) tend to be synthetic. The problem of how pervasive this type of verbal systems may be was not addressed, however.

In fact, there are increasingly fascinating samples of temporal mobility, which happen to be found in several Dardic languages (as Gawri, Khowar, and some others), as well as in neighboring Iranian, where temporal (and even aspectual) marking can be meaningfully absent in part of the finite forms – thus creating a complicated three-level opposition between “temporally mobile”, “aspectually mobile” and “rigid” forms. Presumably, systems of this kind demonstrate that a “mobility-based” typology could have a wider application.

2023,5,16,"Rita Popova (HSE University), Michael Daniel (Collegium de Lyon / Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage)",‘Small’ is big. Number suppletion in size property words,"Adjectival number suppletion — a phenomenon considered as unexpected on theoretical grounds (Hippisley et al., 2004) — is attested in size-denoting adjectives of three different IE branches, namely in Mainland Scandinavian, Brittonic and Megleno Romanian languages. Swedish suppletive adjective ‘small’ is by far the most widely cited example: 

(1)  en liten flicka 
a small girl
‘a small girl’

(2) två små flickor
two small.pl girl.pl
‘two small girls’ (Nurmio, 2017) 

This, and the other two cases of suppletion attested in Indo-European, were object of detailed etymological investigations in the course of the last decade (see Börjars & Vincent, 2011 for Mainland Scandinavian, Jørgensen, 2012 and Nurmio, 2017 for Brittonic, Maiden, 2014 for Megleno-Romanian). Theory-wise, Maiden (2014) attempts to explain why it is specifically size adjectives that deviate from regular expression of number, by examining the historical stages that led to the eventual development of suppletive paradigms for ‘small’ and ‘big’ in Scandinavian and Megleno Romanian. It is argued that all known instances of number suppletion in adjectives came to life under similar circumstances and should be attributed to a single linguistic force that disrupts the usual pattern of inflection precisely in size properties. Nurmio (2017) takes a step forward by bringing into light evidence from 3 non-IE languages and suggests “a strong tendency for adjectives denoting size, ‘small’ and ‘big’, to develop this type of suppletion” (Nurmio 2017: 26). In this study, we hope to continue the typological line of research and to make a contribution to the topic by presenting a more diverse collection of number conditioned irregularities in the expression of size properties across the world. 

First, we put the “strong tendency” suggested by Nurmio (2017) to a more rigorous testing.  By researching several lexical databases and typological surveys, we obtained data on number encoding for a fixed subset of eight prototypical property meanings (Dixon 1982), namely ‘small’, ‘big’, ‘long’, ‘short’, ‘young’, ‘old’, ‘good’, ‘black’ in a convenience sample of some 100 languages where at least one of these items shows number-related irregularity. Our sources include typological studies of suppletion in general (Hippisley et al., 2004, Veselinova, 2006, Vafaeian, 2013) and three lexical databases: Global Lexicostatistical Database (Starostin, 2011), Intercontinental Dictionary Series (Key & Comrie, 2023), and Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (Greenhill et al., 2008). Even though absolute numbers remain low, we see that this broader cross-linguistic evidence supports the idea of size-properties being more prone to number-conditioned stem alternations than other properties. 

Next, we discuss various theoretical interpretations and implications of this generalization. We revisit the analysis of sources and paths of grammaticalization of ‘small’-suppletion in (Maiden 2014) in the light of these new data. There are a few cases when we are able to trace down the histories behind the suppletive pairs similar to the studies of Indo-European suppletion; however, in most cases we do not know much about the etymologies of the lexical items involved. In a synchronic functional perspective, we try to relate ‘small’-suppletion to research on a different but related type of number suppletion, namely the studies on verbal number (see especially Durie, 1986, Mithun, 1988, François, 2019), a link hinted at by Nurmio (2017).

Evolution and Spread of Politeness Systems in Indo‐European","In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of pronominal politeness in the Indo-European languages and demonstrate that the processes of change of pronominal systems related to politeness follow two evolutionary regimes, one inside the ‘Standard Average European’ (SAE) linguistic area and another outside of it. Historical processes of language change differ at different levels of linguistic structure. In general, we presume that lower level, unconscious aspects of language change slowly over phylogenetic time, giving rise to patterns of relationship that can often be described as a family tree. Aspects of language that are consciously manipulated by speakers are expected to vary at a faster rate and to diffuse within areas of contact. Politeness is a social phenomenon, so we expect these systems to be highly susceptible to areal norms of interaction. We show that the similarities of SAE politeness systems can be accounted for with a model of convergence due to parallel evolution in a shared (social-demographic) environment, rather than by genealogical relatedness or borrowing. By quantifying and testing factors determining rates of structural change, we offer a novel and realistic approach that can explain similarities between distantly related languages sharing the same environment."
2023,4,4,Michael Daniel (Collegium de Lyon / Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage) ,Directionality is a key to understanding the part-of-speech typology in East Caucasian languages (and beyond),"Starting from the 1990s to the present, functional typology has seen a lot of typological debates about (how to deal with) non-universality of part-of-speech inventories across languages (Croft 1990, Hengeveld 1992, and a survey in Bisang 2010). In these discussions, building part-of-speech typology is viewed as investigating the ways in which languages group words into classes so that the resulting classification is relevant to their morphosyntax. As morphosyntax of languages varies greatly, we can expect - and indeed observe - differences in their inventories of parts of speech. The discussions have been primarily focused on languages that show inventories that are reduced as compared to expectations (underspecified parts of speech in van Lier & Rijkhoff 2013), such as lacking adjectives as a separate part of speech (Dixon 1977) or lacking major distinctions of parts of speech altogether; see re-assessment of the assumed “mergers” in Arkadiev et al (2009) for Adyghe, in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2006) for adjectives cross-linguistically, and Haspelmath (2012) for a general methodological stance. But there is more to such a variation than eventual mergers. In this talk, I am going to suggest a tentative re-interpretation of the morphosyntactic status of the category of directionality in East Caucasian. In the existing descriptive grammars, markers of directionality are usually viewed as cross-categorial markers that can be added to different classes of words. In the talk, I will draft a comprehensive inventory of the notional classes of stems that are involved in the derivation of directional forms; will show how this grouping is also relevant to syntax; and will ultimately argue that they all can be seen as belonging to one - and separate - part of speech, which I suggest to call spatials (or spatial words).

Although knowledge of language structure is integral in evaluating the accuracy and comprehension of language models, the emphasis on syntax in interpretation methods is insufficient. In this study, we introduce a framework to conduct syntactic probing across various languages and large language models.   Drawing data from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) and Universal Dependencies (UD), we compile a linguistically diverse set of languages and investigate mBERT multilingual language model for its capacity to encode syntactic information in relation to word order and relative clauses. In order to do so we make use of a novel syntactic querying interface allowing to gather data from UD collection.  Our findings support the notion that mBERT exhibits a gap in recognizing syntax and a tendency to favour Standard Average European (SAE) languages when intersecting with existing diverse datasets."

However, none of these methods provide ways to directly compare contact scenarios from a typological perspective. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a sampling procedure for worldwide comparisons of language contact scenarios. The sampling unit consists of sets of three languages. The Focus Language is the language whose structures we examine in search for contact effects; the Neighbor Language is genealogically unrelated to the Focus Language, and counts as the potential source of contact influence on the Focus Language; the Benchmark Language is a relative of the Focus Language neither in contact with the Focus nor with the Neighbor language, and is used for disentangling contact effects from genealogical inheritance in the Focus Language. Through this design, we compiled a sample of 49 three-language sets (147 languages in total), which we present here. By switching the focus of typological sampling from individual languages to contact relations between languages, our method has the potential of uncovering patterns in the diffusion of language structures, and how they vary and change."

This study is aimed at identifying possible strategies of forming such construction in the languages of the world, and their distribution.

In such cases, I take into consideration those adjacent functions and their possible semantic relations with a collective meaning in constructions with numerals."
2023,3,7,Aigul Zakirova,Number marking on verbs in the East Caucasian languages,"In this talk I describe different patterns of number marking on verbs, using mainly grammatical descriptions  Possible ways to analyze number marking on verbs are discussed: 1) as agreement, i.e. as an operation by which morphological featuresare copied from one word form onto another, 2) as a special category of verbal number.  Besides, I dwell on the factors by which this marking is conditioned. As it turns out, the Nakh and the Avar-Ando-Tsez branches feature number marking strategies, which are limited to a lexically defined set of verbs. Number markers in this case are localized in the verb stem. On the other hand, in many branches of the family, a different situation is also common: number marking is conditioned by the TAM-forms of the verb, i.e. by grammatical factors.  Finally, the diachrony of number marking is considered. I propose that the verb forms which are marked for number often go back to copular constructions where the predicate position is occupied by a participial form. As a result of grammaticalization of these constructions into verbal forms, the original nominal number marking on the participle develops into verbal number marking."

The perspective adopted is that all three have their place in the linguist’s toolbox: they have relative advantages and disadvantages that often complement one another, so converging evidence of more than one kind can reasonably be sought in many instances. Points are illustrated mainly with examples from syntax, but often can be easily translated to other levels (e.g., phonology, morphology, semantics, and pragmatics)."

I propose a new analysis of the traditional syntactic categories N and Adj, suggesting that the principal properties of nouns and adjectives are largely determined by the presence of (valued or unvalued) inherent gender. Furthermore, I show how this system is able to extend to other lexical categories such as prepositions (and linkers) as well as verbs."

Open Sci. 9: 211252.,"Within linguistics, there is an ongoing debate about whether some language structures remain stable over time, which structures these are and whether they can be used to uncover the relationships between languages. However, there is no consensus on the definition of the term ‘stability’. I define ‘stability’ as a high phylogenetic signal and a low rate of change. I use metric D to measure the phylogenetic signal and Hidden Markov Model to calculate the evolutionary rate for 171 structural features coded for 12 Japonic, 2 Koreanic, 14 Mongolic, 11 Tungusic and 21 Turkic languages. To more deeply investigate the differences in evolutionary dynamics of structural features across areas of grammar, I divide the features into 4 language domains, 13 functional categories and 9 parts of speech. My results suggest that there is a correlation between the phylogenetic signal and evolutionary rate and that, overall, two-thirds of the features have a high phylogenetic signal and over a half of the features evolve at a slow rate. Specifically, argument marking (flagging and indexing), derivation and valency appear to be the most stable functional categories, pronouns and nouns the most stable parts of speech, and phonological and morphological levels the most stable language domains."

For Uralic we can reconstruct a broadly easterly homeland and an east-to-west distribution of the earliest branch ancestors, followed by northward spreads. Applying similar reasoning to Nakh-Daghestanian, there is also a directionality in early branch ancestor locations and diffusions of typological features, and there is geographical and archaeological evidence not available for Uralic.

2023,1,31,"Konstantin Filatov (HSE University), Vladimir Plungian (MSU, IL RAS, RLI, HSE)","New Testament as a parallel corpus, and parallel corpus as a typological data base: a different look","The use of parallel texts for typological research is a long-existing practice, significantly enhanced with the advent of corpus technologies (informative surveys of the problem can be found in Cysouw & Wälchli 2007, Aijmer 2008, Frajzyngier & Mettouchi 2015, Doval & Sánchez Nieto 2019, among others). For a wide-scale cross-linguistic study, especially efficient instrument is what is usually called “massively parallel corpus” including sample texts from a very large number of languages (up to several hundred; cf. Östling 2016, Нестеренко 2019). For that purpose, the best choice would be the texts which are not only the most translated but targeting the less studied languages at the same time. Virtually the only candidate that satisfies both conditions is obviously the New Testament: as of now, at least fragments of this text are translated into more than 3,200 languages (including extinct, poorly documented or unwritten ones). Again, its importance for cross-linguistic studies is a well-known fact (first attempts to use New Testament translations going back as early as to the 18th century, as in Gottfried Hensel’s “Synopsis universae philologiae” with the earliest language maps known). In present-day typology, the story begins probably with Haspelmath 1997 and is continued by a number of fairly diverse approaches, as, for example, Barentsen 2008, Wälchli & Cysouw 2012, or Dahl 2014. However, all existing attempts to use New Testament follow roughly the same pattern: they (i) take one lexical or grammatical phenomenon of a presumably universal extent (as verbs of motion or perception, spatial adpositions, markers of current relevance, etc.), then (ii) try to identify cross-linguistically reliable contexts for it and (iii) analyze the variation observed. Here, the focus is on one particular piece of data supposed to be identifiable in many doculects constituting the parallel corpus. What we would like to propose is somewhat different. Our focus is not on a single category, but on the whole set of cross-linguistically relevant values belonging to the Universal Grammatical Inventory. Accordingly, the parallel corpus is viewed not as a mere collection of repeated occurrences, but as a complete database of grammatically relevant contexts where a corresponding grammatical value is most expected. The results of our preliminary research suggest that it is possible to isolate typical contexts for main tense and aspect values (as future and prospective, progressive, iterative and habitual, resultative and framepast), for main argument roles, for number and determination values, etc. Not all grammatical categories can be localized in this way, but only those with a clear semantic prototype, sometimes called “inherent” (cf. Frajzyngier & Mettouchi 2015). Nevertheless, the cases in point are numerous, and we are going to demonstrate some examples of how the relevant grammatical contexts can be profitably studied using the continuous annotation of New Testament parallel corpus.

Iamitives (from Latin iam ‘already’) overlap in their use with perfects but differ in that they can combine with stative predicates to express a state that holds at reference time. Iamitives differ from ‘already’ in having a higher frequency and showing a strong tendency to be grammaticalized with natural development predicates. We argue that iamitives can grammaticalize from expressions for ‘already’. In this study, we extract perfect grams and iamitive grams iteratively starting with two groups of seed grams from a parallel text corpus (the New Testament) in 1107 languages. We then construct a grammatical space of the union of 370 extracted grams by means of Multidimensional Scaling. This grammatical space of perfects and iamitives turns out to be a continuum without sharp boundaries anywhere."

The study shows a high degree of crosslinguistic diversity, even among closely related languages.

2023,1,17,Elena Shvedova (HSE University),An outline for studying the system of verbal patterns in Urmi Neo-Aramaic,"There is some general idea of what Semitic verbal ""patterns"" (also called templates, binyanim, породы) are — not only among semitists, but also among linguists. The expected canonical verbal root in Semitic languages is purely consonantal, and inflected verb stems are created through a restricted number of derivational templates. These templates encode in a semi-systematic manner such dimensions of verb meaning as agency and voice. It is well described that verbal patterns can vary between languages — usually the variability of the number of the patterns, their individual form and function are mentioned. However, it is assumed that the template systems have more or less the same morphosyntactic status in all Semitic languages. The main task of my future research is to determine the status of verbal patterns in the system of Christian Urmi Neo-Aramaic (< Northeastern Neo-Aramaic < Semitic), a language with a significantly reduced, ""non-classical"" Semitic verbal system. On the one hand, three Urmian verbal patterns just mark the inflection-class membership of the verb. On the other hand, for some verbs the change of the pattern can be described as a morphological mechanism of changing valency. I will discuss the problems of establishing consonantal root in Christian Urmi, regularity of the patterns’ meanings and possible directions of my future work. Reading Group: Schreur, J.

Predicting grammatical gender in Nakh languages: Three methods compared by Wichers Schreur, Allassonnière-Tang, Bellamy, Rochant","The Nakh languages Chechen and Tsova-Tush each have a five-valued gender system: masculine, feminine, and three “neuter” genders named for their singular agreement forms: B, D and J. Gender assignment in languages is generally analysed as being dependent on both form and semantics (e.g. Corbett 1991), with semantics typically prevailing over form (e.g. Bellamy & Wichers Schreur 2022, Allassonnière-Tang et al. 2021). Most previous studies have considered only binary or tripartite gender systems possessing one masculine, one feminine, and one neuter value. The five-valued system of Nakh thus represents a more complex and insightful case study for analysing gender assignment. In this paper we build on the existing qualitative linguistic analyses of gender assignment in Tsova-Tush (Wichers Schreur 2021) and apply three machine-learning methods to investigate the weight of form and semantics in predicting grammatical gender in Chechen and Tsova-Tush. Our main aim is thus to show how three different computational classifier methods perform on a novel set of non-Indo-European data. The results show that while both form and semantics are helpful for predicting grammatical gender in Nakh, semantics is dominant, which supports findings from existing literature (Allassonnière-Tang et al. 2021), as well as confirming the utility of these computational methods. However, the results also show that the coded semantic information could be further fine-grained to improve the accuracy of the predictions (see also Plaster et al. 2013). In addition, we discuss the implications of the output for our understanding of language-internal and family-internal processes of language change, including how loanwords are integrated from Russian, a three-gender language."

2022,12,13,Konstantin Filatov (HSE University),"Towards a working definition of ""verbal grammatical system""","This talk is part of my project on the diachrony of verbal grammatical systems in Andic languages (< Avaro-Ando-Tsezic < Nakh-Daghestanian). Before analyzing diachronic scenarions in the domain of verbal grammar, it would be wise to delimit the scope of relevant phenomena, i. e. to define what the verbal systems are. However, in existing literature on verbal categories (including a well-known Dahl 1985’s monograph with the word “system” in the title), a little attention is paid to the core concept, and the term is most often just taken for granted. Combining the approaches that have been advanced by V. A. Plungian (1998, 2011) and V. S. Khrakovsky (1996), I believe that a verbal grammatical system can be profitably described considering at least 5 types of relations between meanings and forms: (i) clustering of meanings — focusing on the internal structure of a polysemous marker (ii) cumulation of meanings — focusing on cumulative / separated expression within grammatical markers (iii) categorization patterns — focusing on how grammatical meanings are allocated to (same or different) categories (iv) degree of morphologization — focusing on morphological / periphrastic continuum (v) morphotactic interactions — focusing on how a meaning can affect the expression of other grammatical meanings within the wordform I will discuss each of these features in detail and exemplify them with facts from Andic languages."
2022,12,6,Masha Kyuseva (Surrey Morphology Group),Semantic factors in case loss: the Serbian-Bulgarian dialectal continuum,"Over time there has been a dramatic loss of rich case systems across languages of Europe. The analysis of historical texts has revealed the general picture about how this process occurred, yet the details of how it was implemented largely elude us. In particular, what happens to the case meanings when the morphological form falls out of use? Are they all expressed by an alternative form? Do they merge with the meanings of another case? Or is the unity of meanings that was supported by a common inflectional form completely dismantled? To answer these questions, we propose to look at data where this change is still taking place, namely within the South Slavonic dialect continuum formed by Serbian and Bulgarian. We focus on the decline of one case, the instrumental, in its non-prepositionally governed uses. Our analysis shows that the meanings of the instrumental are not covered by one alternative means of expression, but are split over a number of different prepositional constructions. The choice of prepositions is not random and is largely determined by functions of the original case form. This suggests that this case has no unified meaning (contra Jakobson 1936), and behaves more like a contingent cluster of functions. Reading Group: Poplack, S., & Levey, S. (2010).

In existing descriptions (Verhees 2019, Maisak 2021) for other Upper Andi varieties (predominantly of the villages of Andi, Gagatli and Rikvani), it is shown that besides typologically common functions of additive particles (such as additive, scalar additive, concessive, coordination, topic marking, part of indefinite pronouns), the particle =lo can be used as well in typologically less described contexts, such as constructions for collective numerals, converbal clauses, and as a part of the subordinating marker =lodːu and comitative marker -loj. The goal of this talk is to make a description of those contexts in which =lo is attested in Zilo Andi and to understand the semantic contribution of =lo in different functions.

We investigate this through an analysis of the relative focus on statistical reporting versus linguistic description in the way the results are reported and discussed in research articles published in four major corpus linguistics journals in 2009 and 2019. The results display a marked change: in 2009, a clear majority of the articles exhibit a preference for linguistic description over statistical reporting; in 2019, the exact opposite is true. The number of different statistical techniques employed has also gone up. Whilst the increased statistical focus may reflect increased methodological sophistication, our results show that it has come at a cost: a diminished focus on linguistic description, evident, for example, through fewer text excerpts and linguistic examples, which appears to be symptomatic of increasing distance from the language that is the object of study. We discuss these shifts and suggest some ways of employing sophisticated statistical techniques without sacrificing a focus on language."

Other ‘small’ languages, especially those spoken in Georgia and Azerbaijan, have been characterised by heavy language contact or language shift (or sometimes both), such as Khinalug (Rind-Pawlowski, p.c.), Kryz (Authier 2010) and Udi (Gippert 2008). The Nakh language Tsova-Tush has been spoken in Georgian-dominated territory since time immemorial, and shows heavy lexical borrowing (Desheriev 1953; Wichers Schreur 2021). An often noted, but not thoroughly investigated aspect of Georgian linguistic influence is the restructuring of the Tsova-Tush system of clause combining, especially subordination. In this talk, the most common types of Tsova-Tush subordinate clauses will be presented, along with their comparison to Georgian on the one hand, and to other Nakh languages on the other. This will give us the opportunity to hypothesise about the origin of the various subordination strategies, especially taking into account historical Tsova-Tush data.

2022,6,28,Samira Verhees,Language vitality and attitudes in Botlikh (Dagestan),"Botlikh - a minor unwritten language of Dagestan - is evaluated by UNESCO as ""definitely endangered"", which means the language is no longer passed on to children. Like many Dagestanian languages, Botlikh is under pressure from Russian as the language of socio-economic mobility. Additionally, Botlikhs have been subsumed under Avars since the 1930s as part of linguistic and ethnic planning policies of the Soviet Union, and their language is still not officially recognized. As a result, there are no resources for the language besides two academic dictionaries that are not for sale to the public. Despite all these factors that we might expect to have a negative impact on language vitality, the language seemed rather alive to me during my trips to Botlikh. I observed children of different ages speaking Botlikh at home as well as to their peers. In the village Miarso I even collected language data at the local school, where all of the children were proficient in the language. So I decided to conduct a survey among speakers of Botlikh to learn more about their language habits and how they view their own language: with whom do they speak it, do they find it important to pass it on to the next generation, and how do they see the future of the language. In the talk I will discuss the results of my survey and the method I used to collect data from Dagestan remotely."
2022,6,14,Nikita Beklemishev (HSE University),History of the spread of /f/ in southern Daghestan,"Among Nakh-Daghestanian languages, /f/ is found in the inventories of most Lezgic languages and Khinalugh. In early comparative works (e.g. Gigineyshvili 1977) the presence of /f/ was considered a Lezgic innovation, but, as it turns out, there might be an areal trace. I suggest that the sound was introduced to some languages through lexical borrowing, and to some others through inheritance. As a consequence, /f/ has different degrees of phonological “entrenchment”, and different patterns of distribution across lexicon. Notably, all f-languages are located in southern Daghestan and have been under strong influence from Azerbaijan. My goal is to examine the phonemic status of /f/ in the languages of southern Daghestan, to survey the ways how, and time intervals when, it might have appeared or have been introduced, and to discuss how one single process could have been applied to different languages in different ways. I will discuss several methods to evaluate the phonological entrenchment of /f/ and ways to determine the probable donor of /f/ as a borrowed phoneme, as well as complex areally-genetic generalizations that the study delivers."
2022,6,7,Maksim Melenchenko,Dialectal variability and diachrony of numeral systems in East Caucasian languages,"According to the traditional overviews, languages of the East Caucasian family have decimal, vigesimal, or mixed numeral systems. Using data from grammars and dictionaries, I have tried to explore the variability of these numeral systems and their morphological features in detail, focusing on isoglosses between languages and their dialects. In the talk, I will present the results of this research and discuss several cases of dialectal variability of numeral systems and their possible implications for diachrony of numeral systems in the family. The found results call into question the consensual opinion that vigesimality is „native“ for East Caucasian languages and that it existed in proto-East Caucasian."
2022,5,31,"Rita Popova, Michael Daniel (HSE University)",Size matters? Testing size effects in gender assignment in four East Caucasian languages,"In this study we test for referent size effects in nominal classifications of four East Caucasian languages. It was suggested by Kibrik (1977) that in Archi, Lezgic, assignment of nouns to Gender 3 and Gender 4 shows tendencies based on referent size. The idea has been echoed in Corbett (1991), Corbett & Fedden (2018) who suggest, more specifically, that, in Archi, big entities are assigned to Gender 3. For Lak, in his discussion of the reconstruction of the «original» system of class assignment, Zhirkov (1955) proposes that historically Gender 3 was assigned to all animals, natural phenomena, round-shaped and large objects. To our knowledge, for other Lezgic languages that are genealogically related to Archi and show a similar four-way classification (i.e. have two inanimate genders in addition to feminine and masculine), no such effects have been reported, whether because they are weaker or absent altogether. The aim of this talk is to statistically test the hypothesis of referent size effects for Lak, Archi, Rutul and Tsakhur. What we want to see is whether Archi is indeed so different in this respect from Rutul and Tsakhur, its sister languages, and whether it is similar to Lak, its neighbour. We will first classify and refine the original hypotheses. We suggest that three different types of effects can in principle be expected, including absolute size effects observed in the lexicon at large (pace Corbett and Zhirkov), categorial size effects observed within specific conceptual categories (pace Kibrik) and, finally, referent size effects leading to flexible gender assignment (again, pace Kibrik; see also Di Garbo 2013, Di Garbo 2014, Di Garbo & Agbetsoamedo 2018), the latter functionally akin to diminutives and augmentatives (Grandi 2015). We then review cross-linguistic evidence of any of the three types. Next, we will discuss methods to detect such effects in a statistically meaningful way. Unlike shape or conceptual categories, size is not based on a (nearly) categorical judgment, such as ‘is.human’ or ‘is.round’, but is a relative and scalar category based on judgments like ‘is.bigger’ or ‘is.smaller’. It is not immediately clear how to manually annotate referent size or establish thresholds for entities to be judged absolutely big or small. This may be the reason why they are rarely mentioned in overviews of East Caucasian nominal classifications (Xajdakov 1980, Ivanova 2019). We decided to run several experiments about size judgments, for which we used Russian speakers in the hope that size judgments will have at least some cross-linguistic validity. After running two different experiments (and also using data from McRae et al. (2005) and Binder et al. (2016)), we collected a small database of concepts that made it possible to check for different types of size effects, not only in the four languages in the analysis, but also, in principle, for any language. To test for correlations between being small and Gender 4 and being large and Gender 3, we mapped the concepts of the database onto nominal vocabularies of the four languages. We do not observe absolute size effects in gender assignment. We do observe categorial size effects in some but not other tested conceptual categories. Referent size as reflected in flexible gender assignment has not been tested experimentally; in Archi, it seems to be more lexically limited than in the systems discussed by Di Garbo in African languages, and requires further investigation.

In a number of Nakh-Daghestanian languages, questions of this type have dedicated morphological marking (suffixes or enclitics), although there seems to be no systematic study of their marking types. I will look at the marking of meditative questions in comparison with the marking of ordinary (polar and content) and indirect questions in several languages of the family. I will also briefly discuss the typical contexts where meditative questions are found in texts."

2022,4,19,"Matthew Carter (University of California, San Diego)",Polyfunctional Argument Markers in Ket: Implicative Structure within the Word,"Ket is the last of the indigenous Yeniseian languages of central Siberia. Ket indexes both subjects and direct objects on the verb, but the way in which this is done varies significantly from one lexeme to another, forming a fairly complex system of inflectional classes (Nefedov & Vajda 2015). There is substantial reuse of material across different classes, such that the same marker may be the sole marker of the subject (1), or a co-exponent of the subject with another marker (2), or an object marker (3), depending on the verb. Furthermore, several argument markers represent a fusion or reanalysis of historically distinct markers, and alternatively or simultaneously encode completely orthogonal functions, (marking tense, cf. 4 and 5), or serve no obvious function. This situation, wherein same marker systematically encodes different functions across different lexemes, is known as Polyfunctionality (Stump 2015). It represents a type of complexity of exponence (Anderson, 2015), a phenomenon wherein there is a non-isomorphic or otherwise opaque relationship between units of meaning (e.g. tense, person) and the formal units which are used encode them (e.g. affixes, stem alternations). Polyfunctionality of the type seen in Ket would seem to present a communicative challenge in decoding; If the same marker can encode many different functions across different lexemes within the same subsystem of the morphology, on an arbitrary basis, how does a Ket listener understand which of the possible functions is intended in the given instance? This problem is made more acute by the fact that the language is pro-drop and exclusively head marking with regard to core syntactic arguments (Kotorova & Nefedov 2016).  The potential communicative challenges presented by complex form~meaning mappings has been a major focus of much recent work in morphological complexity (Ackerman et al. 2009, Ackerman & Malouf 2015, Sims & Parker 2016). Such work has largely focused on the question of how speakers of morphologically complex languages predict forms which they have never directly encountered (the so-called Paradigm Cell Filling Problem). If a language can encode the same information in many different ways (via affix allomorphy, stem changes etc.), how does a speaker know how to encode the information in any given form, provided that they have never encountered that form before? As a solution, such work implicates the property of inflectional paradigms known as implicative structure (Wurzel 1984). The morphology of a language exhibits implicative structure if known forms of a lexeme provide clues to unknown forms, such that all cells in a paradigm can be predicted from some subset of these cells. By hypothesis, form~meaning mappings in a language may be complex, provided that the necessary form can be predicted in any given instance (the Low Conditional Entropy Conjecture).  However, this work has largely not focused on the role that implicative structure may play in decoding, as opposed to encoding, complex form~function mappings, nor on the role of implicative structure in syntagmatic, as opposed to paradigmatic, structure. Using data drawn from both published sources and original fieldwork, this paper demonstrates that in Ket, although individual argument markers are often highly polyfunctional, they are organized into networks of implicative relations which greatly reduce uncertainty with regard to their function in any particular instance. In other words, the range of possible functions for a particular argument marker can be greatly reduced by observing which other argument markers are present or absent in the same wordform, and which features those encode (cf. 6 and the dependency graph in 7). In this way, uncertainty with regard to the function of the wordform can be kept low, even without reference to the syntactic context or knowledge of paradigmatically related forms. As a case study, Ket is suggestive of a sort of “Low Conditional Entropy Conjecture in decoding”, wherein individual markers may be highly polyfunctional, provided that their functions can be determined in any given instance. The role of syntagmatic implicative structure in achieving this in Ket underscores the point made by Sims and Parker (2016) that the amount of work done by implicative structure is a point of cross-linguistic variation. It also makes predictions for other head-marking languages with very high complexity of exponence. "
2022,4,12,"Evgeniya Korovina (Institute of Linguistics, RAS)",Borrowings and contacts in basic vocabulary and classification,"Despite the fact that, by definition, the basic vocabulary consists of words that are borrowed least often, borrowings in this part of the lexicon happen regularly. This ranges from highly visible loanwords from languages of other families, such as Spanish borrowings in the languages of the indigenous population of Latin America, as well as hard-to-find loanwords and structural parallelism (homoplasy) between languages within the same subgroup. Cases of the second kind are especially typical for the so-called dialect chains, where it is sometimes difficult to draw a line between idioms, as well as in situations of significant phonetic conservatism of languages. Using examples from the history of, first of all, the languages of Central America and Polynesia, in my talk I'll try to consider ways to formally mathematically identify such situations."
2022,3,29,"Рамазан Абдулмажидов (ИИАЭ ДНЦ РАН), Шахбан Хапизов (ИИАЭ ДНЦ РАН)",Тысячелетняя история письменности на языках народов Дагестана: взгляд сквозь призму веков,"Дагестан представляет собой регион с удивительным этническим и культурным многообразием, который единственный на Северном Кавказе имеет многовековую историю письменности. Еще в советский период был зафиксирован факт создания уникальной письменности Кавказской Албании, генетически связанной с армянским и грузинским письмом. Это государство, как известно, простирало свои границы на большей части современного Дагестана. Подлинный прогресс в исследовании албанской письменности связан с выявлением в 1990-х гг. в монастыре на Синайском полуострове 2 палимпсестов предположительно VII в., написанных на «агванском» языке. Только после их исследования удалось окончательно установить его место среди восточнокавказских языков. Второй по времени опыт письменной фиксации речи на восточнокавказских языках (в данном случае на аварском языке) связан с распространением в Дагестане православия и грузинской письменности. Деятельность миссионеров здесь сопровождалась подготовкой и обучением служителей церкви из числа местного населения, составлением текстов на грузинском языке. Начало профессиональному исследованию грузинографической эпиграфики Дагестана было положено в первой половине ХХ в. Ну и следующий этап развития письменности в Дагестане был связан с его исламизацией, и последовавшей за ней экспансией мусульманской культуры. Письменность на арабской графике для записи текстов на восточнокавказских языках начала использоваться еще в средневековый период, хотя вряд ли этот опыт имел системный характер. Из числа зафиксированных и ныне сохранившихся памятников наиболее ранней является аварская надпись XIV в. на камне, вставленном в стену мечети сел. Корода Гунибского района Республики Дагестан. Все эти этапы и процессы развития письменности в Дагестане будут в развернутом виде освещены в настоящем докладе."
2022,3,22,Timofei Dedov (HSE University),Days after tomorrow in the languages of Daghestan,"In the languages of Daghestan, days after tomorrow can be encoded in different ways. Three different types of strategies can be distinguished: 1) using semi-compositional terms with similar suffixes; 2) using transparently compositional constructions (like in most languages); 3) and using non-derived terms, which seems to be rare cross-linguistically. Some East Caucasian languages also differ from most other languages in the number of unique terms that are used to refer to the days after tomorrow (for the third strategy, the amount of unique terms for consecutive days after tomorrow can be as high as six). In my talk I will discuss all three strategies in more detail, and introduce the geographical distribution of these strategies, which was investigated for the “Typological Atlas of the languages of Daghestan”."

Accusative languages include nominative, genitive, accusative, and dative. Some languages also include other grammatical cases besides the basic ones, e.g., affective, comitative, instrumental, comparative, and ablative. More exotic cases like contentive and benefactive are reported for a couple of languages. In this talk, I discuss the classification and distribution of systems of grammatical cases in the languages of Daghestan, which is the result of my research within the TALD (Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan) project. Apart from classifying the languages according to the type and number of cases they include, I will also present the morphology of the grammatical cases per language group, their syntactic functions, and instances of case syncretism."
2022,3,15,Katherine Hodgson (University of Cambridge),"Zok, the Armenian dialect of Agulis","Zok (otherwise known as the Agulis dialect of Armenian) is a form of Armenian that is so divergent that it has been described by some as a separate language. It was spoken in and around the town of Agulis in the southern part of Nakhijevan. The first written record of Zok is from 1711, but there were Armenians living in this area from at least the 5th century AD. The Armenian presence in Agulis itself ended with the massacre of 1919, but dialect-speaking populations remained in some of the surrounding villages, notably Tsghna, Tanakert, Ramis, and Paraka, until the 1970s and 80s. Closely related dialects are still spoken today in a few villages just across the border in the area of Meghri in Armenia. However, with the exception of Karchevan (population 292), these villages are now virtually abandoned, and the language is not being passed on to the younger generation. It is the subject of a documentation project funded by the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme. Speakers from the villages Tsghna, Tanakert, Ramis, and Paraka in Nakhijevan, and Karchevan and Kuris in the area of Meghri have produced 27 hours of video, of which 4 hours have so far been annotated using ELAN and FLEx. Zok is not intelligible to speakers of other forms of Armenian, and various claims have been made about the origin of the speakers. However, a closer linguistic examination reveals that many of its distinctive features are shared wholly or partly with neighbouring Armenian dialects, especially those of Karabagh and northern Iran, implying that the Zoks are a local Armenian population with a long-term, stable presence in the area. The existence of geographically-correlated dialect variation between the villages where the language is spoken (the closer together they are, the more features they have in common) also suggests a stable pattern of settlement. Apart from phonological features (vowel shift, vowel harmony), the most striking distinctive characteristic is the development of a verb system that is unique within Armenian. This involves the loss of all monolectic verb forms in the indicative mood, and their replacement with participles + auxiliary, a tendency that exists in Eastern Armenian in general, but has nowhere else reached this extent. This is accompanied by the shift of tense marking from the auxiliary, which has become essentially a person marker, to a particle added to the ‘present’ (unmarked) form, something which is also found in Khoy/Urmia dialect. The past subjunctive is also formed in this way. Both these processes, as well as the mobility of the auxiliary/person marker, which attaches to the element with the main sentential stress, are characteristic of languages of the Iran-Araxes area."
2022,3,1,"George Starostin (Centre for Comparative Studies and Phylogenetics of the Institute for Oriental and Classical Studies, HSE / External Fellow, Santa Fe Institute)","The role of proto-wordlists in modern historical-comparative studies: from phonetic and semantic to ""onomasiological"" reconstruction","Although lexicostatistical methods of estimating linguistic distance between related or potentially related language units have become an essential staple of modern day phylogenetic linguistics, their reliability often depends more on the accurate collection and curation of data than on the specific mathematical / computational methods applied to said data. In my talk, I shall try to delineate the theoretical and pragmatic importance of a relatively new methodology, dubbed ""onomasiological reconstruction"", which purports to introduce a new level of accuracy to the projection of lexical items onto proto-levels of varying time depth. This methodology, which requires paying equal attention to phonological, semantic, and distributional features of compared items, can then be combined with lexicostatistical methods and applied with equal efficiency to varying datasets and linguistic taxa of widely varying time depth. In addition to having already yielded efficient results across genetic lineages ranging from Indo-European to North Caucasian to African language families, onomasiological reconstruction seems to hold plenty of potential for successfully differentiating between ""patently false"" and genuinely promising hypotheses of distant linguistic relationship."
2022,2,22,Matthias Urban (University of Tübingen),Typological patterns and the language dynamics of the ancient Central Andes and South America,"In this presentation, I will sketch different aspects of the language dynamics of the ancient Central Andes of Peru and Bolivia –one of the few “cradles of civilization” of humanity – and South America more generally. I will highlight in particular the role of linguistic interaction and contact and the resulting typological distributions in understanding this dynamics. I will start out from the present-day linguistic landscape of the Central Andes, which is strongly dominated by the Quechuan and Aymaran families whose common contact-induced typological profile has for a long time influenced ideas of what Andean languages are like. I will then broaden the scope and explore how new analyses of the available materials for the now extinct languages of the Central Andes bring to light a now submerged interaction sphere in Northern Peru, and how this north-south structure is congruent with archaeological and molecular anthropological evidence, allowing for new ways of interdisciplinary dialogue beyond language expansions. Finally, I will broaden the scope again, and show how recent work in the areal typology of broader parts of the Andes and South America articulates with these new findings. This work suggests a finely spatially structured gradient of typological variation in the Andes into which the new evidence from the Central Andes fits seamlessly. The proper interpretation of this gradient is presently not clear yet, though one possibility is that it is a reflection of an ancient layer of affinities between the languages of the region."
2022,2,1,"Pavel Astafiev, Nikita Beklemishev, Nina Dobrushina, Alina Russkikh (in alphabetical order)",Looking for areal patterns in the domain of discourse formulae: The case of blessings and curses in Daghestan,"It is a well-known fact that certain discourse markers, such as interjections, formulae of greetings or leave-taking, vocatives or politeness markers are often borrowed (see Andersen 2014 for some references). The claim is primarily derived from the data on material borrowings, such as English OK or Russian davaj, but there is also scarce evidence of pattern borrowing in this domain. Studies mention the similarity of greetings in some areas (Matisoff 2011 in South-East Asia, Lüpke & Watson 2020 in West Africa) or good-night expressions in contacting languages (May God wake us up in Ewe and Likpe - Ameka 2006). There are few systematic studies of the spread of discourse patterns across certain areas, such as word iteration in the Mediterranean (Stolz 2004) or morning greetings in Daghestan (Naccarato & Verhees 2021). Areal comparison of some types of formulae can also be investigated in anthropology; for example, some formulae are included in the world-wide database of folklore and mythological motifs (Berezkin & Duvakin, http://www.ruthenia.ru/folklore/berezkin/). Many questions remain unanswered: are discourse formulae more diffusible than grammar? Do the areal distributions of formulae correspond to the areal distributions of linguistic features of other levels? How strong is the genealogical signal in the distribution of discourse formulae? What is their role in the transfer of various grammatical phenomena? In this talk, we will approach this issue from the perspective of wish-expressions, or blessings and curses in Daghestan. We will present the database of wish-expressions in nine languages of Daghestan. One of the problems with cross-linguistic comparison of blessing and curses is that it is not fully clear what are the grounds for such comparison, i.e. which wishes of one language should be mapped on which wishes of other languages. We will discuss the problem of cross-linguistics comparison of wishes and our first attempts to process the sets of formulae in these nine languages in order to detect the areal signal.

In the first part, we will provide a brief recap of the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan, a project in which data on typological diversity of Daghestanian languages and their relatives and neighbors is being systematized, surveying a general approach to data collection and examples of features. In the second part, our colleagues from the Arctic Lab will present similar data from their research on linguistic diversity of the languages of Northeast Siberia (from Samoyedic branch of Uralic in the west to Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic to Yukaghir, Nivkh, Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Aleut-Yupik-Inuit in the east). Finally, in a third part, we will discuss methodological issues and current approaches aiming to define linguistic areas with a global perspective. The seminar will be in a slightly unusual format, probably more interactive than usual and primarily intended to share experience and ideas, and with contributions from different research groups. We also invite comments from other participants that embark on comparable enterprises and encounter similar challenges."

In the first part of the talk, I provide an overview of the project and its different strands, including 1) an investigation of the sociolinguistic situation of the region with a particular focus on strategies of language choice studied with ethnographic observations and with a sociolinguistic questionnaire (Khachaturyan and Konoshenko 2021); 2) a comparative study of the grammars of these two languages and their close linguistic relatives and identification of convergent and divergent features, including those potentially related to pattern (Konoshenko 2015: 176‑177) and matter borrowing (Khachaturyan 2019); 3) a study of translation, and especially religious translation, translatory artefacts and practice of translation, as a locus of contact and source of convergence (Khachaturyan 2020, Khachaturyan and Konoshenko in prep.). In the second part of the talk, I present an experimental study focusing on the acquisition of a particular morphosyntactic parameter of Mano, namely, reflexive marking, and the impact of the speakers' exposure to Kpelle on the acquisition process. I present the experimental design, preliminary results and theoretical questions which the study aims to address."
2022,1,11,Aigul Zakirova,Adjectival agreement in the East Caucasian languages: an overview,"Few sources deal with the origin of number agreement in the languages of the world. Apart from the theoretical work (Lehmann 1982), only several case studies have been published, among them (Frajzyngier 1997, Di Garbo 2020, Cruz 2015). The EC languages are numerous, and adjectival number agreement in EC seems to be morphologically and diachronically heterogeneous, which leads one to believe that it is innovative. This makes the EC languages suitable for investigating the origin of number agreement. However, no study of this kind has been undertaken yet. The goal of this study is to make a survey of number agreement patterns in EC, to assess the weight of genealogical and areal factors in the distribution of patterns and then try to describe paths by which adjectival plural agreement may have originated in the EC languages. I use the methodology adopted in the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Dagestan: So far, I searched in grammars of the EC languages and the neighboring languages (overall 65 idioms) to find out how adjectival plural agreement is expressed in each of them. I divided the languages into three types: obligatory / optional / absent plural agreement. For the optional type I established the factors that influence the presence of number agreement and plotted these types on maps."
2021,12,21,"Polina Nasledskova, Tatiana Philippova",Postpositions in East-Caucasian languages: a description and comparative perspective,"Our study summarizes and analyzes the information about postpositions provided in the various grammatical descriptions of East-Caucasian languages. In our talk, we are going to briefly report on our findings and discuss the prospects. First, we are going to propose an overview chapter on postpositions and several features for maps in the Typological atlas of the languages of Daghestan (TALD) that we are currently working on. Second, we are going to present our conception of a paper about East-Caucasian postpositions from a typological perspective. In particular, we are going to show that despite the fact that a number of properties of East-Caucasian postpositions differ significantly from the typical properties of adpositions in general and Indo-European prepositions in particular, the difference is not due to their special status, but due to the fact that they usually do not serve the functions of primary adpositions in other languages. Rather, East-Caucasian postpositions are more similar to the secondary adpositions in other languages, while typical primary adpositions more often correspond to the East-Caucasian spatial suffixes rather than to postpositions. Finally, we are going to suggest that the notions of localization and directionality, widely used for the description of spatial forms in East-Caucasian languages, can help better describe the meanings and functions of primary adpositions in other languages (e.g. Russian), if applied as comparative concepts."
2021,12,14,"Ezequiel Koile, George Moroz",Detecting linguistic variation with geographic sampling,"Geolectal variation is often present in settings where one language is spoken across a vast geographic area. This can be found in phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical features. For practical reasons, it is not always possible to collect fieldwork data from every single location in order to obtain this full pattern of variation, and we must select a group of locations to be surveyed, in order to resemble the underlying distribution of linguistic features. We propose and test a method for sampling different locations where a language is spoken, finding the optimal places to be included in a sample, with the goal of obtaining a distribution of typological features representative of the whole area. For this goal, we use different clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering of locations based on their geographic distribution, and define our sample of locations on the basis of this clusterization. We test our methods against simulated data with different distributions of linguistic features, on various spatial configurations, and also against real data from Circassian dialects (Northwest Caucasian). Our results show an efficiency higher than random sampling, both for detecting variation and for estimating its magnitude, which makes our method profitable to fieldworkers when designing their research."

Some of these domains are more developed and have more prominent results than others. We are going to highlight existing lacunae and make an overview of known tools for Field NLP and present our research in this field. We will cover automatic transliteration, segmentation, speech recognition, morphological glossing and others. We believe that the only way to advance the Field NLP is working as a community. Hence we aim to find common grounds with all scholars engaged in studies and documentation of minor languages. With this in mind, we will specifically address the problem of digital preservation of linguistic data."
2021,11,30,Dmitry Nikolaev (University of Stuttgart),Studying language contact using neighbour graphs: From consonant-inventory prediction to analysis of segment borrowability,"The aim of this talk is to demonstrate the advantages of using geographical nearest-neighbour graphs for large-scale study of language contact. After discussing the motivation for using nearest-neighbour graphs in typological linguistics and briefly surveying the ways of constructing them, I will present two case studies. In the first one, I will show that a nearest-neighbour graph gives a flexible and efficient way of showing the importance of language contact for modelling the composition of segmental inventories of Eurasian languages; I will argue that at a certain time depth language contact becomes a better predictor of consonant-inventory structures than phylogenetics. In the second case study, I will show how SegBo, a recently presented dataset of borrowed phonemes, can be used to construct a world-wide graph of language contact and then will use this graph to model comparative borrowability of different phonemes."

First, I will show a small corpus of narratives and songs in Yupik languages which I have collected during my fieldwork. Second, I will present sociolinguistic data: following (Dobrushina 2013), I used the method of retrospective family interviews and gathered some first-hand data on language repertoires of Yupik people (namely, their knowledge of other Yupik languages, Chukchi, Russian and English), the history of Yupik-Chukchi relations and the history of relations between speakers of Chaplinsky (Central Siberian) Yupik in Novoje Chaplino and on St. Lawrence Island (USA) (cf. Morgounova 2007). Third, I will describe constructions with wordforms containing suffixes -st caus, -sq ask, -nəχsiʁ expect, -niq say in Chaplinsky Yupik. As has been previously noted for the reportative suffix -niq say (Vakhtin 2007: 109-115), wordforms with ‑niq can be analyzed as consisting of two predicates: the matrix predicate ‘say’ and the dependent predicate. I develop this analysis and argue that constructions with all four listed suffixes represent examples of morphologically bound complementation (Maisak 2016, Panova 2020). Dobrushina N. (2013).

2021,11,9,George Moroz,Comparing cross-language phonological profiles,"This talk considers different strategies for comparing the phonological profiles of languages. This can be useful for comparing different related lects (dialectology), unrelated lects (phonological typology), different diachronic states of the same lects (historical linguistics), models for language acquisition/loss, some NLP tasks, etc. I discuss two different strategies for comparing phonological profiles: the complexity-based approach and the distance-based approach. In the first approach, researchers propose different ways of calculating phonological complexity (Nichols 2009; Maddieson 2009; Coupé et al. 2009), which can be used in cross-language comparison (see criticism of this approach in (Simpson 1999; Deutscher 2009; Ohala 2009)). In the second approach, scholars apply different measures for calculating the distance between languages based on phonology (Heeringa 2004; Eden 2018; Anderson et al. 2021). There are two methods used in the distance measurement literature: * parametric approach: different feature sets (segment inventory, feature inventory, typological phonological features like stress and syllable structure) are used for distance calculation; * cross-entropy approach: entropy is used for the analysis of some samples of language data (corpus, dictionary).

2021,10,26,Susanne Michaelis (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology),Avoiding bias in comparative creole studies: Stratification by lexifier and substrate,"One major research question in creole studies has been whether the social/diachronic circumstances of the creolizaton processes are unique, and if so, whether this uniqueness of the evolution of creoles also leads to unique structural changes, which are reflected in a unique structural profile. Some creolists have claimed that indeed the answer to both questions is yes, e.g. Bickerton (1981), McWhorter (2001), and more recently Peter Bakker and Ayméric Daval-Markussen. But these authors have generally overlooked that cross-creole generalizations require representative sampling, especially when working quantitatively. Sampling for genealogical and areal control has been a much discussed topic within world-wide typology, but not yet in comparative creolistics. In all available comparative creoles studies, European-based Atlantic creoles are strongly overrepresented, so that typical features of these languages are taken as “pan-creole” features, e.g. serial verbs, double-object constructions, or obligatory use of overt pronominal subjects. But many of these Atlantic creoles have the same genealogical/areal profile, i.e. European (lexifier) + Macro-Sudan (substrate). I therefore propose a new sampling method that controls for genealogical/areal relatedness of both the substrate and the lexifier, which I call “bi-clan” control (where “clan” is a cover term for linguistic families and convergence areas)."
2021,10,19,Natalya Stoynova,Assessing inter-speaker variation in contact-influenced Russian,"In this talk, I will deal with Russian speech of older speakers of Nanai and Ulcha (Southern Tungusic, the Amur region). A great inter-speaker variation takes place: some bilingual Nanais and Ulchas are speakers of a “near-pidgin” Russian variety, the speech of some others does not differ greatly from the monolingual benchmark. The data used in the study come from the Corpus of contact-influenced Russian of Northern Siberia and the Russian Far East (http://web-corpora.net/ruscontact/corpus.html). This is a small spoken corpus provided with a manual annotation of contact-induced grammatical features (non-standard agreement, non-standard argument encoding etc.). Based on this annotation, I will try to assess the inter-speaker variation attested in the corpus. On the one hand, I will show which contact-induced features appear to be more stable, i.e. equally represented in texts produced by different speakers, and which ones contribute to inter-speaker variation most of all which features behave similarly, i.e. are equally frequent / infrequent in texts produced by the same speakers. On the other hand, I will discuss how speakers group together according to contact-induced features typical of them whether these clusters of speakers correlate with any sociolinguistic parameters whether they go in line with the researcher’s intuition or look surprising. An additional motivation for this study is methodological. I will test how precisely the existing corpus annotation captures the degree of deviation from monolingual benchmark and inter-speaker variation."
2021,10,5,"Daniil Ignatiev, Nick Howell, George Moroz",Computational processing of Bagvalal morphology: problems and future tasks,"Bagvalal is a minority language of the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. Like many indigenous languages, Bagvalal lacks tools for computational processing of language data. While field researchers have accumulated a relatively large amount of linguistic data in documentation projects, it is still insufficient for statistical approaches to text processing to be applied. The talk discusses a rule-based technology for text processing that was successfully used to design a prototype morphological glosser for the Kwanada dialect of Bagvalal. Lack or insufficiency of certain types of lexical and grammatical data, to be discussed in the talk, complicates further tuning of the instrument as well as its application to other Bagvalal dialects. However, further work on the analyzer could facilitate fieldwork and make it possible to design a machine translation system for Bagvalal."

The testbed is Lower Fungom, a rural area of western Cameroon where small-scale multilingualism has been widely documented. In the talk, we will present (i) epistemological issues posed by contexts of small-scale multilingualism and the methodological responses we have put in place to address them, mainly concerning the need to explore individual-based variation; (ii) initial findings from the study of individual-based wordlists by applying tools originally designed for cognate detection for historical linguistic purposes to questions of synchronic variation, and (iii) the correlations that such lexicostatistical data have with geographic distance vs. travel difficulty between locales associated with distinct languages."

For several alternative phylogenies, we find that geographic distances correlate with linguistic divergence. Notably, qualitative classifications show a better fit with the geography than cognacy-based phylogenies. We interpret this result as follows: the better fit may be due to implicit geographic bias in qualitative classifications and conclude that approaches to classification other than those based on cognacy run a risk to implicitly include geography and geography-related factors as one basis of genealogical classifications."

2021,6,8,Anastasia Panova,Towards a typology of continuative expressions,"This study investigates how continuative semantics is encoded cross-linguistically. The work is based on two independent language samples: a sample with global coverage and an intragenealogical sample of four Northwest Caucasian (Abkhaz-Adyge) languages. The cross-linguistic sample is genealogically and geographically balanced and includes 120 languages. Means that convey continuative semantics — continuative expressions — are analyzed according to the following parameters: morphosyntactic type (affix, auxiliary, adverbial phrase), degree of grammaticalization, tense-aspect-actionality restrictions on the predicate, non-continuative uses of the continuative expressions and semantic effects when combined with negation. The data come mainly from secondary sources (grammatical descriptions and dictionaries) and parallel texts. The second part of the study focuses on the intrageneological typology of continuative expressions in the following Northwest Caucasian languages: Abaza, Abkhaz, Kabardian and West Circassian (Adyghe). The main sources for the study of continuative expressions in Northwest Caucasian are elicited data and parallel texts. Based on the results of the macro-typological and intrageneological studies and their comparison, I suggest that two typological clusters or profiles of continuative expressions can be distinguished — predicative and adverbial, and that continuative expressions belonging to different classes show different degrees of diachronic stability."
2021,6,1,"Nikita Muravyev, Daria Zhornik",Solving the puzzle of the Ob-Ugric passive,"In this talk, we look at the active/passive voice alternation in two Ob-Ugric languages of Western Siberia, Northern Khanty and Northern Mansi. This alternation has been described in the literature as primarily motivated by information structure: a sentence appears in active whenever an Agent is the primary topic of the sentence, otherwise passive voice is used (Kulonen 1989, Nikolaeva 2001). However recent text and elicitation data suggest that a purely information-structure based approach has a number of shortcomings. First, passive can be used if an Agent is topical yet low in animacy and/or definiteness. Second, focused Agents are allowed in special kinds of active sentences, e.g. interrogative contexts. Moreover, passivization is possible with a great variety of intransitive verbs with no Agent role whatsoever, including state verbs and verbs denoting spontaneous change of state. Also intransitive verbs can be passivised in adversative contexts in which some discourse participant external to the event gets affected in some way. These facts posit a problem both for the abovementioned information-structural approach and for the existing typological accounts of the active/passive alternation. We will discuss these facts in detail, compare the situation in Khanty and Mansi and present a model which helps at least partially solve the Ob-Ugric puzzle. Kulonen U. M. The Passive in Ob-Ugrian.

2021,5,25,"Ilya Chechuro, Michael Daniel",Looking for areal convergence in nominal gender assignment in East Caucasian,"In this talk, we investigate whether the data on nominal gender assignment in East Caucasian - more specifically, Lezgic - languages show any evidence for areal convergence. To do so, we consider those Lezgic languages and their immediate neighbours that feature four-gender systems, including Budukh, Kryz, Rutul, Tsakhur and Archi, and compare them to Lak, Archi’s immediate neighbour, and Khinalug, immediate neighbour of Kryz and Budukh. In all these languages, Gender 3 and Gender 4 are semantically heterogeneous, so shared assignment may be due to (a) common inheritance, (b) areal convergence, or (c) pure chance. A quantitative analysis of gender assignment across the lexicon documented in Kibrik and Kodzasov (1990) suggests that Archi is more similar to its neighbour Lak than to any of its Lezgic cousins. No such result has been obtained by comparing Khinalug and its Lezgic neighbours Budukh and Kryz. We will discuss various methodological refinements we attempted to unravel the genealogical and areal signals, and to distill both of them from the impact of crude semantics. These attempts were purposefully based on the use of data external to East Caucasian (World Loanwords Database; Wordnet) but so far have not been successful - so we will ask for your ideas to improve our methodology."

2021,4,20,Susanne Michaelis (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology),Grammatical co-expression patterns in creoles and their parent languages: comitative and related functions,"In this talk, I will report on an ongoing project on grammatical coexpression patterns (or polysemy patterns) in creole languages and their parent languages, such as illustrated in examples (1)–(4). The Seychelles Creole polysemous marker (av)ek ‘with, and, by’ (< French avec ‘with’) is used to express four different grammatical functions: comitative (1), instrumental (2), passive agent (3), and noun phrase conjunction (4). (1) comitative Mon 'n travay avek Sye Raim. 1SG PRF work com Mr Rahim ‘I have worked with Mr Rahim.’ (Bollée & Rosalie 1994:14f.) (2) instrumental Nou fer servolan nou file ek difil. 1pl make kite 1pl let.glide with thread ‘We made a kite and let it glide with a thread.’ (Michaelis 1994:66) (3) passive agent Mon’n ganny morde ek lisjen 1sg.prf pass bite pass.agent dog ‘I have been bitten by a dog.’ (Michaelis & Rosalie 2000:82) (4) noun phrase conjunction Mari ek Pyer ‘Mary and Peter’ When comparing the specific coexpression pattern of Seychelles Creole (av)ek with the patterns in its parent languages, it becomes clear that in French, the lexifier language, the marker avec ‘with’ only covers a subset of the meanings that the Seychelles Creole marker (av)ek covers, namely only comitative and instrumental. By contrast, the Passive agent is expressed by par ‘by’ in French, and noun phrase conjunction is expressed by the coordination marker et ‘and’. However, Makhuwa and other neighboring Bantu languages of East Africa (the most important cluster of substrate languages relevant for Seychelles Creole) show the same coexpression pattern as the one cited for Seychelles Creole. Here, the marker ni (van der Wal 2009:113) covers all four grammatical meanings that we saw for Seychelles Creole, comitative, instrumental, passive agent, and noun phrase conjunction. The hypothesis of the paper goes beyond Seychelles Creole: It extends to potentially all creole languages. I suggest that grammatical coexpression patterns in creoles are not randomly distributed, but they systematically reflect the grammatical coexpression patterns of their substrate languages, and much less so those of their lexifier languages. Here I investigate 10 creole languages from around the world (genealogically maximally distinct) and their parent languages for the grammatical markers expressing comitative, instrumental, and noun phrase conjunction (and related meanings). Recent literature (e.g. Baptista 2020) suggests that “convergence” of functions (and possibly forms) of the parent languages is a major driving force for shaping creole grammars. Indeed, at first glance the coexpression pattern of a grammatical marker ‘with’ in a creole language seems to mirror overlapping, convergent grammatical meanings between its lexifier and its substrate language(s). But a closer look at the grammatical coexpression patterns of similar ‘with’-markers in genealogically different creoles and their parent languages reveals that it is the coexpression patterns of the substrates that tend to be imposed on the nascent creoles, irrespectively of the degree of convergence of the lexifier patterns with those of the substrates and/or the creole. Thus, comitative, instrumental, passive agent and np-conjunction are shared by Makhuwa and Seychelles Creole, whereas French only converges in comitative and instrumental with both Makhuwa and Seychelles Creole.

2021,4,13,Aigul Zakirova,From noun plural to plural agreement: evidence from Andi dialects (and beyond),"Noun plural markers sometimes grammaticalize into markers of plural agreement on various targets: e.g. Turkic –lar (Erdal 2004: 231 for Old Turkic, Matasović 2018 for Karaim), similar developmens can be postulated for the Adyghe -xe (Lander et. al. forthc.), and Nivkh -ɣun (Gruzdeva forthc.). The process of grammaticalization of noun plural marking into plural agreement marking on other types of targets has not, to my knowledge, been dealt with in typological literature. A way to compensate for this gap would be to describe scenarios of such evolution in particular languages and language groupings. Andi (Avar-Andic < Avar-Ando-Tsez < East Caucasian) presents an interesting case of grammaticalization of a plural marker -(V)l into a number agreement marker. I will address the question of how this mechanism of number agreement might have evolved. -(V)l is most probably the reflex of *li, one of the reconstructed Proto-Andic plural markers (Alexeyev 1988: 92-93). Whereas related Andic languages have an extensive list of plural markers that hardly have something in common, in most Andi dialects -(V)l was generalized as a nominal plural marker. The next step was the extension of -(V)l onto other word forms, i.e. targets of agreement, both inside the NP and onto verbal forms and adverbs. The behavior of -(V)l on different types of targets will be condisered in order to come to a plausible scenario. In a more descriptive vein, I will compare the -(V)l-agreement to the more ""canonical"" gender agreement, also present in Andi. Finally, I will briefly consider examples of similar developments in the related East Caucasian languages."
2021,4,6,Thomas Wier (Free University of Tbilisi),Squaring the circle in the Caucasus: Perspectives on Sprachbünde and Language Contact,"Linguists have long noted both the exceptional internal diversity of the Caucasus, but also that many of the features of languages found there are not found in immediately adjacent regions of Eurasia. In the last two centuries, the question has thus arisen more than once: to what extent do these unusual features arise from language contact, and to what extent can they be explained by other (phylogenetic, typological, or indeed statistically random) traits? In this lecture I will review three different sets of answers that have been proposed: Klimov (1965, 1973); Tuite (1998); and Chirikba (2008). After reviewing these arguments, I will suggest that while autochthonous Caucasian languages do share a quantitatively large number of phonological and morphosyntactic traits in common, qualitative similarities are more probative in answering the question of whether the region constitutes a true Sprachbund, and a better approach might be to distinguish micro- and macro-Sprachbünde."
2021,3,30,Oleg Belyaev,Contact influences on Ossetic: A general overview,"In many ways, Ossetic has a unique status among languages of the Caucasus. Belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family, Ossetic is the last living representative of Sarmatian varieties once widely spoken in the northern Black Sea region. Having long developed in isolation from other Iranian languages, Ossetic has, on the one hand, preserved a number of archaic features; on the other hand, it has developed unique innovations, some of which may be explained by language contact. The Ossetic lexicon, mainly being of Iranian origin, has a comparatively large share of loanwords from neighbouring languages, many of them in the basic lexicon. In phonology, a key contact-induced feature is the presence of ejective consonants, mainly in Caucasian loanwords. Some grammatical features of Ossetic (word order, case system, structure of complex clauses) may also be contact-induced. Therefore, the data of Ossetic are valuable both for the typology of language contact and the study of early contacts of Ossetians / Alans and other ethnolinguistic groups. In the talk, I will provide a general overview and discussion of lexical and grammatical features of Ossetic that may be contact-induced, and a preliminary analysis of which contact situations could have led to these results."
2021,3,23,"Anastasia Panova, Michael Daniel",Linguistic complexity across East Caucasian: from the eye of the beholder to corpus based measures,"Measuring complexity in typology is deemed relevant for the sociolinguistic take on language diversity, connecting complexity of language structures to such diverse but correlated factors as language size, its relative isolation, its L2 acquisition and multilingualism of its speakers. Yet on the empirical side, measuring complexity is difficult not only because the measures are sometimes calibrated in what may seem an arbitrary way, but also - and certainly not less importantly - because they depend on the analysis in a grammar. As one example, Kibrik (1977) counts over a million of synthetic verbal forms in Archi; but excluding verificative and especially quotative 'series' from inflectional morphology dramatically reduces this abundance. Similarly, measuring phonetic complexity based on the cardinality of inventories may deliver different stories depending on the approach; the status of [x] in Archi (only Russian loans) is very different from its status in Rutul (native lexicon); including or excluding rare allophones (Archi [ɮ]) and variants (Mehweb [ɣ]) that sometimes do and sometimes do not make their way into the descriptive inventories could in theory influence the outcomes of the quantitative comparison, and it is not absolutely obvious what can be the impact of these factors on the comparison. A way to avoid this would be (i) using shallow counts that minimize the analytical impact of language descriptions and (ii) making counts in corpora rather than deriving them from descriptive grammars. In this talk, after a brief survey of the existing corpus based approaches to measuring language complexity, we discuss several experiments we carried out to measure morphological and phonetic complexity across unannotated corpora of the languages of Daghestan. We (dual, exclusive) are very much looking forward to having feedback and suggestions as to how further develop this take."
2021,3,16,Alexandra Vydrina,Multilingualism as a genre-structuring strategy: the case of Kakabe traditional narratives,"Various West-African language communities show the use of a specific type of code-switching that is limited to the genre of traditional narratives: songs that appear in such narratives regularly include passages that are in a language different from the principal language of the narration. This type of conventionalized multilingualism is a regular phenomenon that is recurrently found across languages of West Africa. However, so far, it has never been object to any systematic investigation. In my presentation, I will analyze this type of multilingual practice on the data of 70 Kakabe traditional narratives, investigating the specific mechanism of switching from one language to the other and its relation to the wider context of the type of multilingualism found in this speech community."

Basque has a set of spatial cases, in which the ablative encodes Source and Path, and the allative conveys Goal. Additionally, there are both directional and terminative case-markers. In some dialects, this general tableau becomes more complicated, and historical records also provide additional complexity, such as an ancient dedicated perlative marker [Lafon 1948]. As Basque spatial cases can mark animacy, asymmetries in the encoding of motion events must also consider this parameter [Creissels & Mounole 2011; Krajewska 2021]. I will present an incipient study on the Source-Goal asymmetry, which will be part of comprehensive research on the evolution of the Basque case-system. Pursuing Zaika’s study [2016], I will analyze the behavior of verbs of motion, putting and posture, as well as the case-markers and non-grammaticalized postpositions they make appear. This work will consider dialectal variation, diachronic factors, and the role of language contact. To this end, I will exploit existing corpora and other materials, and collect new data from fieldwork with speakers of several dialects. References Creissels, Denis & Mounole, Céline (2011).

2021,3,4,Natalia Kuznetsova,Rare features in phonological typology,"The talk will touch upon theoretical aspects of existing and emerging accounts on rare features in phonological typology, in general, and in word-prosodic typology, in particular. Rarities can be ignored by linguistic theory, be reanalysed as regular, or be incorporated by changing the theory. Phonological rara and rarissima used to be rather ignored or reanalysed, but the trend seems to be changing, with always more data coming in from lesser-studied languages, on the one hand, and a strengthening interest of linguistic typology in geographic and evolutionary aspects related to the cross-linguistic distribution of linguistic features, on the other hand."
2021,3,4,Giuliano Castagna,"Modern South Arabian: archaism, innovation and contact in the Arabian peninsula","It has long been known that the Modern South Arabian subgroup of the Semitic language family, made up of six endangered languages spoken in Oman and Yemen, exhibits a set of characteristics regarded by Semitic scholars as archaic, such as: large sound systems including lateral fricatives and affricates, and glottalised stops and affricates; productive subjunctive and conditional moods, as well as other characteristics that may be reminescent of classical Semitic languages, such as the reverse gender agreement between numerals and nouns, and the presence of second and third person feminine and dual pronouns. However, certain other features of these languages have not been analysed in detail by mainstream Semitic literature. In fact, some of these features have not been discussed at all: for example, the presence of a first person dual pronoun, and the apparently non-Semitic facies of a sizeable part of Modern South Arabian lexis. Moreover, the unexplained relationship between Modern South Arabian languages and a huge amount of undeciphered epigraphs found mostly in caves and on rocks and boulders, calls for further studies. These epigraphs employ a modified version of the south Semitic script, and are found not only in the present-day range of Modern South Arabian, but also further north-east into Oman proper. This presentation aims at providing a general introduction to the Modern South Arabian languages, and highlighting the above-mentioned issues, as well as advancing some working hypotheses."
2021,3,2,Tim Zingler,Form and function in morphological typology,"The goal of linguistic typology is to understand the interactions of form and function in the languages of the world. Typically, investigations conducted in this research paradigm take a certain functional domain (e.g., ‘causative/applicative’) as the starting point and subsequently analyze by which formal means it is expressed. In this talk, though, I will argue that typology can also benefit from following the opposite approach, that is, by focusing on a specific type of linguistic form (e.g., infixation) and analyzing which functions it encodes.The major advantage of the latter strategy is that linguistic forms are ultimately less variegated than linguistic functions, which facilitates comparison.This strategy will then allow typologists to develop a more nuanced theory of morphology and to account for areal patterns that manifest themselves in the distribution of linguistic forms. In order to support these claims, I will draw on novel research on the suffixing preference."
2021,3,2,Riccardo Giomi,"A Functional Discourse Grammar typology of reflexives, with some notes on reciprocals","This chapter presents the first-ever Functional Discourse Grammar typology of reflexives and opens the way to a comparable typology of reciprocals. The main finding of the paper is that the striking morphosyntactic diversity of reflexive markers can be reduced to only three basic classes, which differ as regards the structure of the predication frame on which the construction is built. In Type I reflexives the lexical predicate takes two coindexed arguments; Type II reflexives are based on a one-place frame in which the predicate bears a reflexive (or reflexive/reciprocal) operator; finally, Type III reflexives are characterized by the presence of a configurational predicate which takes both an external and an internal argument. All further differences are explained with reference to different ways of aligning the underlying pragmatic and semantic structures of each construction-type – more specifically, the number and information-structural status of referents at the Interpersonal Level and the number and structural position of verb arguments at the Representational Level. A further advantage of the proposed typology is that of accounting for possible differences in the lexical distribution of reflexive markers on the basis of the notion of partially instantiated predication frames, i.e. partially lexicalized constructional templates of the Representational Level."
2021,3,2,Julie Marsault,The prefixal template of Umóⁿhoⁿ: case study of the “dative” prefix,"Umóⁿhoⁿ (Siouan), a highly endangered Native American language spoken in the United States, possesses a highly complex verbal morphology, in particular a series of arbitrarily ordered derivational and inflectional prefixes. After a brief introduction to the language, I will present the verb’s prefixal template, then focus on the prefix gí-, usually called “dative”. The case study of gí- covers several key issues of Umóⁿhoⁿ morphology: (1) change of slot of person marking triggered by the presence of other prefixes; (2) multiple exponence of the dative and of person marking; (3) semantic demotivation and lexicalization of the prefixes. Building on these developments, I will show that the dative prefix exhibits both inflectional and derivational characteristics."

I will start with an overview of existing lexicons of grammaticalization (which are very few) and how they can serve as source of inspiration for the Nakh-Daghestanian Lexicon. I will then present example entries of the future Lexicon and mention the choices and the problems one has to face when creating such a Lexicon. Comments and suggestions from the audience will be most welcome."
2021,2,9,Tatiana Philippova,Adpositions and case: Categorial issues,"This talk will address the issue of the categorial status of case markers and adpositions from a cross-linguistic perspective. I will present some major research questions arising in this respect, including the following: • How do we approach the case/adposition delineation problem in languages with case suffixes and postpositions? • Is it feasible to posit a cross-linguistically uniform category of postpositions? If yes, is it principally distinct from that of prepositions? • Can we meaningfully compare language-specific categories of case and adpositions across languages? Having introduced these questions, I will give an overview of the state of the art in research on this and related topics. Please note that this will be an overview talk, rather than one showcasing the results of my own research. And I expect that there will be plenty of room for discussion!"

After a general introduction about the language and the history of its research (Timur Maisak), we shall present the ongoing project on the glossing of Bagwalal dialectal texts (Aleksandra Trepalenko). The texts first published in Gudava's (1971) grammar in Georgian represent all six villages where Bagwalal is spoken. We are going to present the results of our analysis of the texts (glossing, translation), mention the main dialectal differences and describe some interesting features of Bagwalal and problems we faced during our work."

Caritive (aka abessive) expresses the non-involvement of a participant into a situation, with the non-involvement predication semantically modifying the situation or a participant of a different situation, like in English Mary came without John / money. The project aims at studying the means of expression of caritive meanings in the languages of the world. We developed a questionnaire and collected data from a representative sample of 100 languages. I am going to discuss the methodology of the project: the definition of caritive, questionnaire, methodology of collecting data. The project is still in progress, but I will present some preliminary results."
2021,1,19,Chingduang Yurayong (Mahidol University),Postposed -to in North Russian dialects through the lens of Finnic languages in contact,"The use of demonstrative-derived morphemes in the head-following position is characteristic of North Russian dialects (-to and its variants -ta, -tu, -ti, -te, …) and eastern Finnic languages (-se [singular] and -ne [plural]), such as Olonets Karelian, Lude, and Veps. In terms of function, some previous studies regard these grammatical elements as definite articles, while other recent studies identify additional functions related to information structure and discourse. Given that an equivalent construction is not observed in Belarusian and Ukrainian, and -to in other Russian dialects mostly remain invariable, several studies propose that declinable -to in North Russian could have resulted from language contact with the Uralic-speaking population who adopted Russian as their second language, particularly Finnic speakers. Of many aspects of the research question, this presentation will focus on exploring contexts of use of -to in North Russian and -se in Finnic from the perspectives of referentiality, information structure, and evaluation. Potential development paths will also be discussed by paying attention to the Russian-Finnic contact scenario during the past millennium."

I attempt summarizing the data on borrowed postpositions (both between branches of East Caucasian family and into East Caucasian from languages of the other families). I suggest contact origins of some postpositions whose diachrony is unclear from the sources. I will also provide an overview of the typology of borrowed postpositions. I ultimately aim at correlating borrowing of postpositions in East Caucasian with other contact-induced changes in the languages of the family.

2020,12,22,Sergey Say,Using BivalTyp (www.bivaltyp.info) for measuring (dis)similarities between valency class systems,"The goal of my presentation is two-fold. In the first part, I am going to introduce BivalTyp (www.bivaltyp.info) — a typological database of bivalent verbs and their encoding frames. This database contains information on the ways in which 130 bivalent contextualized predicates (such ‘be afraid’, ‘listen’, ‘touch’) are assigned to valency classes in 85 languages (mostly spoken in Eurasia). This part of the presentation will be user-oriented, i.e., I will focus on the ways data are processed, stored and visualized in the database. In the second part, I will briefly discuss some of the ways in which BivalTyp enriches our knowledge of the ways in which arguments select encoding devices (such as cases, adpositions and verb indices) in individual languages. In particular, I will argue that the very partition of verbs into valency classes can be used as a justified tertium comparationis in cross-linguistic studies of argument encoding. I will also introduce some distance metrics that can be applied to the data from BivalTyp and will discuss genealogically and areally determined similarities between valency class systems in the languages of the sample."
2020,12,15,Ksenia Shagal (University of Helsinki),Multifunctional non-finites in Northern Eurasia,"In this talk, I am going to discuss patterns of multifunctionality that are characteristic of non-finite forms in 50 languages of Northern Eurasia. Specifically, non-finite forms are investigated in terms of the inventory of functions each of them can perform when heading a subordinate clause: reference function (complement clauses), adnominal modification (relative clauses), and adverbial modification (adverbial clauses). The primary questions I will address are the following: (a) What patterns of multifunctionality in non-finites are most common and how are they distributed geographically across Northern Eurasia? (b) Do patterns of multifunctionality differ depending on how prominent non-finite subordination is in a language? (c) Are there any recurrent patterns involving specific constructions, and if yes, can we propose an explanation for their occurrence?"

First, I will introduce some general guidelines for data structures, file formats, and data description. Then I will touch upon the issues related to orthographic systems and discuss the problem of orthographic ambiguity. The first part will be concluded by the discussion of Cross-Linguistic Data Formats (CLDF) and meta-databases such as Glottolog, CLLD and Concepticon. Together these tools form a framework that attempts to facilitate data standardization and sustainable storage. The second part of the talk will deal with data sharing. I will propose several tools for increasing reproducibility of programming code. I will also discuss version control with Git and academic licences. Finally, I will briefly introduce the tools that are useful when submitting a paper: Open Science Framework (OSF.io) and Zenodo."

The main possible oppositions and patterns of colexification in lexical systems are described in the framework of Moscow lexical typology group (Rakhilina, Reznikova 2016). Though in most languages this semantic field appears to be rich, our research did detect language systems without dedicated verbs of falling. We argue that these cases are neither accidental nor culture-specific, but can be seen as following from some fundamental semantic principles."

Thus, they have clitic chi that is considered to have the same functions as Russian li. So, my first research question is what is the distribution of the functions between these quasi-synonymous clitics in the dialects that have both of them? Secondly, I want to talk about their positional properties, depending on the function they have. There were many studies of Slavic clitics in the standard languages, but none (as far as I know) considered dialect data, and that’s what I’ve tried to do."

In this talk, I give an overview of optatives in Nakh-Daghestanian languages and discuss their possible diachronic sources and grammaticalization paths. I also argue for the contact as one reason for the areal spread of the optatives and suggest their prominent role in everyday discourse as a possible reason for this spread."
2020,10,20,Chiara Naccarato,The standard of comparison in the languages of Daghestan,"In this talk I will present the results of my research on the standard of comparison in the languages of Daghestan, which was started as part of the DagAtlas project (the “Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan”). In the languages of Daghestan, the standard of comparison is usually expressed by a spatial form, i.e. an inflected form of a nominal normally expressing a spatial relation. In this study, I classify the languages of Daghestan according to the type of spatial form used to mark the standard of comparison. Following the methodological approach of the DagAtlas project, I collected the data from the available literature and built maps for the visualization of results. The results obtained are discussed both in terms of frequency and distribution within the linguistic area under investigation, and in comparison with broader typological investigations of comparative constructions (Stassen 1985, 2013), which include almost no reference to data from Daghestan. The latter comparison does not reveal surprising findings: the Daghestanian data adhere quite well to the cross-linguistic picture (with a general preference for elative markers). Within Daghestan, the overall picture seems a bit fuzzy, and the distribution of values on maps does not allow to detect any noteworthy areal or genealogical clustering. An exception is constituted by Andic languages, which form a cluster based on the localization marker employed (forms in -č’- indicating contact with some entity)."
2020,10,13,Natalya Stoynova,Inter-speaker variation in code-switching in the situation of language shift. The case of Nanai and Ulch,"In this talk I will present some quantitative data on different structural types of code-switching attested in oral texts in Nanai and Ulch (Southern Tungusic). These texts represent a specific mode of code-switching between Nanai/Ulch and Russian observed in the situation of language shift. Speakers were instructed by the linguist to tell something in their native language, and this was an unusual and artificial way of communication, since both languages are endangered and the dominant language of the speech community is Russian. All the texts contain a lot of Russian fragments of different sizes and morphosyntactic types. I will focus on inter-speaker variation. There is a general assumption that inter-speaker variation increases in the situation of language shift. My preliminary observation is that this, particularly, concerns structural types of code-switches attested in the texts under discussion. First, I will check this observation. Second, I will show that intensity and preferred structural types of code-switching correlate with general narrative habits and skills of a speaker."

We are trying to detect the impact of landscape on linguistic divergence by comparing correlations of linguistic distances with Great Circle (""crow flight"") distances vs. distances calculated taking the terrain into account. This time we expanded our dataset to include Tsezic. We are trying to find ways to solve the problem of the geographic data being so much richer in datapoints than the documented village lects; and of combining slightly different data (such as Swadesh list vs. Jena lists) into a single count.

2020,9,29,George Moroz,Phonetic fieldwork and experiments with the phonfieldwork package for R: rOpenSci review,"There is a lot of different tasks that typically have to be solved during phonetic research. They include creating slides that would contain the stimuli, renaming and concatenating multiple sound files recorded during a session, automatic annotation in ‘Praat’ TextGrids (one of the sound annotation standards provided by ‘Praat’ software, see Boersma & Weenink 2018), creating an html table with annotations and spectrograms, and converting multiple formats between each other (‘Praat’ TextGrid, ‘EXMARaLDA’, ‘ELAN’, subtitles .srt, and .txt from Audacity). All of these tasks can be solved by combining different tools (relabeling is straightforward, Praat contains scripts for concatenating files, etc.). R package phonfieldwork provides a functionality that makes these tasks easy to solve without additional tools, and also as compared to other packages: rPraat, textgRid. During the talk, I will show how the package works and what it can do, explain some changes that were proposed by rOpenSci reviewers and will take your ideas for improvement.

Lezgian dialects are subdivided into the Küre dialect group, the Axceh dialect group and the Quba dialect group. The object of my investigation is spoken in the village of Tsnal of the Khivsky district in the Republic of Dagestan and belongs to the Jark'i dialect of the Küre dialect group (Mejlanova 1964). In this talk I am going to present the Tsnal Spoken Corpus I am working on and to discuss some of my early findings on the Tsnal variety of Lezgian."
2020,9,15,Timofey Mukhin,From spatial deixis to anaphora: data from Lezgic and Tsezic,"Crosslinguistically, demonstratives, in addition to their primary, deictic function, often acquire anaphoric uses. East Caucasian languages have rich inventories of demonstrative pronouns involving not less than three different stems, but do not have dedicated 3rd person pronouns; instead, they use demonstratives. The main goal of my study is to examine which demonstratives are recruited in anaphoric function by obtaining corpus counts, separately for adnominal and independent uses. The study is based on narrative corpora of several languages from the Lezgic and Tsezic branches. I conclude that even closely related languages may show divergent behavior."
2020,9,8,Alexandra Vydrina,Reflexive and the generic use of the second-person pronoun in Kakabe,"Kakabe (Mande) has a reflexive pronoun with an unusual restriction on its antecedent. It cannot appear with referential nouns and pronouns, where regular personal pronouns are used instead. It does appear, however, with generic and quantified subjects, as well as in infinitival clauses. It also appears in correlative clauses with a relativized subject. I provide an account of this unusual distribution, situate the Kakabe data in the broader typological context, and discuss a possible diachronic path from the second-person pronoun involved in the development of the unusual reflexive pronoun in Kakabe."
2020,6,30,Nikita Muravyev,Verbal agreement and voice in the Uralic languages of Western Siberia,"Uralic (Ob-Ugric, Samoyedic) languages located in Western Siberia mostly exhibit a pragmatically-driven verbal agreement system whereby argument indexing on the verb depends on topicality of the core arguments. As shown in (Nikolaeva 2001; Dalrymple & Nikolaeva 2011) for Obdorsk Khanty (Northern) and Tundra Nenets, languages tend to use a Subject agreement paradigm for the Topical A > Focal O setting and a special Subject-Object paradigm for Topical A > Topical O and sometimes also for Focal O > Topical O. Additionally, some languages use inflectional Passive (Inverse) forms for Focal O > Topical A. However a deeper look into at least some languages of this area reveals that the usage of similar agreement and voice forms can depend not only on information structure but on a number of other factors, such as referentiality, animacy, number, assertiveness etc. partly resembling hierarchical indexation systems found in the Americas, South Asia and Australia, see e. g. (Zúñiga 2006). In the first part of the talk I will present my own field data from Kazym Khanty (Northern) with a more intricate verbal agreement system based on topicality and definiteness, compared to the situation in Obdorsk dialect. In the second part I will discuss an initial stage of a comparative areal research done by our project team in an attempt to shed some light on this phenomenon and its underpinnings across Khanty dialects as well as in Mansi and Tundra Nenets based on the text data available. Despite very limited size and time depth of existing corpora and text collections and yet a rather small amount of text material annotated and discussed by our team, the data show several tendencies that allow us to assess the overall situation in the region and to speculate about possible diachronic evolution of agreement and voice systems in the languages under investigation.

2020,6,23,"Ezequiel Koile, Michael Daniel, George Moroz, Ilya Chechuro",Quantitative Linguistic Geography of Daghestan,"We study how geographical factors shape the distribution of languages spoken in Daghestan. An interdisciplinary approach is developed, involving linguistic data, methods based on geographic information systems, and statistics. Using wordlists with the best available granularity, and geolocation data from the Atlas of Multilingualism in Dagestan, we build a geospatial inference modelling for explaining the linguistic diversity of the area. Our project has two stages: (i) A synchronic mapping of the correlation between geographic and linguistic distances, and (ii) a diachronic reconstruction of the speakers’ dynamics, driven by phylogeny and contact events. In this talk, very much a work in progress and an opportunity to discuss the aim and the data, we will only cover the first stage, focusing on the area of North Daghestan where Andic languages are spoken."
2020,6,16,Konstantin Filatov,"Anchiq Karata indicative morphology. Allomorphy, inflectional classes and possible diachronic puzzles","In this talk I am going to present some results of my fieldwork in 2019: a fragment of description of Anchiq Karata (Andic, Avar-Andic-Tsezic, Nakh-Daghestanian) verbal morphology -- the system of indicative verb forms. In the first part of my talk I am going to discuss Time-Aspect markers in three subparts of the paradigm, namely Perfective, Imperfective and Infinitive subsystems. The second part is dedicated to the procedure of establishing and explication of inflection classes. I am going to account for three major verbal inflectional classes (Conjugations) and a few smaller inflectional subclasses of morphophonological nature. Some morphological irregularities in verbal inflection are also going to be surveyed. The third part includes several diachronic questions that Anchiq Karata data on indicative morphology could elucidate in the context of divergence of Central-Andic languages."
2020,6,9,Timofey Arkhangelskiy (University of Hamburg),"Borrowings, frequency and lexical change","In this talk, I am going to explore the relations between borrowability, frequency of use and the dynamics of lexical change, based mostly on corpus data. The talk will have two parts. In the first part, I am going to look at frequency distributions of borrowings in the vocabularies of several languages. As I will show, a simple observation that more frequent words are less likely to be (recent) borrowings captures a facet of a much less trivial correlation. Specifically, the probability of a given word being a borrowing increases proportionally to the logarithm of its frequency rank in a sufficiently large corpus. The second part deals with the question of verbal borrowability. It has been long conjectured that verbs are more difficult to borrow than nouns. I am going to demonstrate that a recent empirical proof of that hypothesis by Tadmor et al. (2010) contains a logical fallacy because it implicitly equates borrowability and diachronic instability. I am going to provide an independent argument in favor of the hypothesis of greater diachronic stability of verbs compared to nouns. Nevertheless, it is not clear a priori whether this is a consequence of their lower borrowability or an independent phenomenon. In the latter case, it could alone cause the discrepancy between the observed proportions of borrowings among verbs and nouns, upon which Tadmor et al. based their argument."
2020,6,2,"Oleg Belyaev, Michael Daniel",Alternative recipient marking in Ossetic: Once-in-a-lifetime clearest case of contact induced change,"Ossetic regularly allows marking recipients in ditransitive constructions using either dative or allative case, a kind of variation that closely corresponds to the distribution of dative vs. lative recipients in East Caucasian languages. We show that the semantic motivation for the choice of marking can be described in terms of transfer of ownership vs. spatial transfer; key evidence is provided by the distribution of the two strategies with instances of the verb 'give' containing and not containing spatial prefixes. As the phenomenon is not attested elsewhere in Iranian and seems to be extremely rare cross-linguistically, it is more than likely that this feature of Ossetic developed as a result of language contact with Nakh."
2020,5,26,Aigul Zakirova,The emphatic particle =gu in Andi dialects,"Andi =gu is an emphatic / intensifying enclitic. Beside contexts where it indicates some kind of contrast / emphasis, =gu is found in combination with many types of hosts where its contribution is less clear. With some hosts =gu is obligatory (e.g. cardinal numbers), with others it is optional. Similar enclitics have been observed for other Avaro-Andic and Tsezic languages, cf. Forker 2015 for Avar, Kibrik et. al. 2001: 713 for Bagvalal. In this study I employ natural texts to answer the following questions: what is the functional range of the Andi =gu? The contexts identified in Avar will then be compared to those discussed in Forker 2015."
2020,5,19,"Aleksandrs Berdicevskis (The Swedish Language Bank, University of Gothenburg)",Native speakers simplify their language when writing to non-natives on an internet forum,"It is often claimed that large proportion of non-native speakers in a population facilitates morphological simplification (Trudgill 2011). There exists evidence in favour of this claim, but much is still unclear about the actual mechanism of simplification. Atkinson, Smith & Kirby (2018), relying on the evidence provided by artificial language-learning experiments, hypothesize that an important role is played by the interaction between speakers, primarily accommodation by more proficient speakers to less proficient ones. It is reasonable to expect that the most prominent case of accommodation would be foreigner-directed language (that is, accommodation by L1 to L2 speakers). I test this hypothesis using the resource described in (Berdicevskis 2018), a collection of large corpora of both L1 and L2 natural written production in four languages (English, French, Italian and Spanish), downloaded from WordReference forums. If the hypothesis about the simplicity of foreigner-directed language is correct, we can expect that L1 speakers would use simpler language when responding to messages posted by L2 speakers. I show that in most cases this is true. In the talk, I discuss to what extent these results support the accommodation hypothesis and, more broadly, general theories about the adaptation of languages to socio-cultural environments.

2020,5,12,Diana Forker,Elevation as a grammatical and semantic category of demonstratives,"In this talk, I study semantic and pragmatic properties of elevational demonstratives by means of a typological investigation of 50 languages with elevational demonstratives from all across the globe. The four basic verticality values expressed by elevational demonstratives are up, down, level, and across. They can be ordered along the elevational hierarchy (up > down > level/across), which reflects cross-linguistic tendencies in the expression of these values by demonstratives and is grounded in our cognitive representation of the vertical axis and the special position of the ‘vertical positive region’. Elevational values are frequently co-expressed with distance-based meanings of demonstratives, and it is almost always distal demonstratives that express elevation, whereas medial or proximal demonstratives can lack elevational distinctions. This means that elevational demonstratives largely refer to areas outside the peripersonal sphere in a similar way as simple distal demonstratives. In the proximal domain, fine grained semantic distinctions such as those encoded by elevational demonstratives are superfluous since this domain is accessible to the interlocuters who in the default case of a normal conversation are located in close proximity to each other. I then discuss metaphorical extensions of elevational demonstratives to non-spatial uses such as temporal and social deixis. There are a few languages in which elevational demonstratives with the meaning up express the temporal meaning future, whereas the down demonstratives encode past. This finding is particularly interesting in view of the widely-debated use of Mandarin Chinese spatial terms ‘up’ for past events and ‘down’ for future events, which show the opposite metaphorical extension. I finally examine areal tendencies and potential correlations between elevational demonstratives and the geographical location of speech communities in mountainous areas such as the Himalayas, the Papuan Highlands and the Caucasus. I conclude that the data from elevational demonstratives do not support the Topographic Correspondence Hypothesis because languages spoken in similar topographic environments do not tend to have similar systems of elevational demonstratives if they belong to different language families."
2020,4,28,Gilles Authier,Verbal morphological complexity in Lezgic languages,"The Lezgic branch of East Caucasian, which comprizes about twelve distinct languages, is very diversified typologically, in particular in the verbal morphology. Lezgic verbal systems grammaticalise variable sets of categories, and show differents types and levels of complexity. Based on an overview of the attested morphological realisations of these verbal categories in all Lezgic languages, our presentation will endeavour to link probable cases of increased and decreased complexity in verbal systems (judging form what we can hypothesize about the proto-Legic verbal system) with two main socio-linguistic considerations: the size of linguistic communities in diachrony and the influence of contact with non-Lezgic languages."
2020,4,21,Daniel Wilson,"Initial report on documentation of Sagada, Tsez Language technology for endangered languages","I am a research fellow at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein, South Africa and now working with the Department of Caucasian Languages at the Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences. I also work for XRI, a research institute which was designed to bridge the gap between academia and humanitarian development initiatives. This talk has two parts. First, I will be presenting an update on the status of my research on the Sagada dialect of Tsez, which I began last summer. The Tsezic languages are a sub-branch of the Nakh-Daghestanian (or East Caucasian) language family. The Tsezic languages are divided into two groups: the East Tsezic group (Bezhta and Hunzib) and the West Tsezic group (Tsez, Hinuq, Khwarshi, and Inkhowari). There is consensus in the prior research on Tsez that it should be divided into two main dialects: Tsez and Sagada, with further dialectal variation within Tsez (Imnaishvili 1963, Radjabov 1999, Abdulaev 2011, Comrie 2007, Polinsky 2015, etc.). The main division between Tsez and Sagada has been made based primarily on the variation noted by Imnaishvili in the middle of the 20th century. The data collected by Imnaishvili have provided most of the present knowledge about Sagada. It has even been noted that Sagada may rightfully be considered a distinct language (Maria Polinsky, Bernard Comrie p.c.). In this talk I will include sociolinguistic details from native speakers of Sagada, specifically how they view their language and its mutual intelligibility with the larger dialects of Tsez. I will also draw attention to phonological, morphological, and lexical similarities and differences between Sagada and Tsez. Second, I will give a brief presentation on the latest developments in language technology for low and zero-resource languages. This is based on my work at XRI and my attendance at the recent conference at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris titled “Language Technology for All.” These latest developments are having a large impact around the world to document and revitalize endangered languages and could be useful for languages in the Caucasus."
2020,4,14,Alexandra Vydrina,Sentence Focus in Kakabe,"This talk draws attention to the diversity of pragmatic functions of Sentence Focus utterances in natural speech on the example of Kakabe, a Western Mande language. It is often ignored in the literature that SF can play multiple roles in discourse. Presentational ‘out-of-the blue’ utterances answering the questions ‘What happened?’ or ‘What’s new?’ are often considered as their main or even their only type of use. Yet the analysis of natural texts shows that SF utterances are at least as frequently used with the so-called explicative function (Sasse 1987; 1996; Matras and Sasse 1995) and the even lesser known inferential function, studied by Declerck (1992), Delahunty (1995; 2001) and Bearth 1992; 1997; 1999b). In particular, I will highlight the intersubjectivity aspect of speech production that is crucial in the understanding of how Inferential SF utterances are used. I will show on the example of Kakabe, a Western Mande language, that when natural speech is considered, apart from introducing all-new events, SF utterances turn out to be associated with a rich array of discourse strategies, such as explicative, elaborative, disruptive functions, etc. Accordingly, the discourse properties of the referents inside SF are subject to variation, and crucially, they affect the implementation of the focus-marking."
2020,4,7,"Tatiana Philippova, Anastasia Panova",Preposition drop and language contact: The case of Daghestanian Russian,"This paper studies the phenomenon of preposition drop — cases where preposition does not appear when we expect it to — in particular, in locative, directional and temporal adverbial phrases. We review and classify the existing analyses of the phenomenon that were proposed for different languages, predominantly non-standard and contact varieties. Next, we proceed to our quantitative study of preposition drop in Russian spoken in Daghestan, based on data collected from the sociolinguistic interviews of the DagRus corpus. We show how preposition drop depends on various linguistic and sociolinguistic factors, employing statistical methods. Level of Russian, preposition type and phonetic context turn out to be good predictors for preposition drop. We propose a functional explanation for the observed pattern."
2020,3,31,Anastasia Yakovleva,Greek diglossia: a case study of spatial marking in Katharevousa,"According to Ferguson (1959), in a diglossic situation two distinct varieties of a language (‘high’, learned by formal education, and ‘low’ colloquial) are spoken in the same community. He claims that High variety always exists in a stable codified form, whereas Low demonstrates wide variation in grammar and vocabulary. Although this is the case for some diglossic societies (such as Tamil), for others the situation is the opposite . My corpus analysis of Katharevousa (official language of Greece till 1976) demonstrates the instability of this register in the domain of spatial relations."
2020,3,24,Samira Verhees,"What is a quotative evidential, and does it exist?","Reported speech markers constitute a substantial part of evidentiality’s semantic domain. At the same time, the internal division of this subdomain into specific values remains disputed. Aikhenvald (2004) proposed an important distinction of reportative and quotative markers: reportatives refer to information based on hearsay, while quotatives refer to information based on the verbal report of a particular source. Several authors have since argued that quotatives (in contrast with reportatives) are not proper evidentials (among them are Boye (2010) and Holvoet (2018)), because they designate a proposition, rather than specify the speaker’s information source. In this talk I will discuss the typology of reported speech evidentials and compare the properties of ""quotative"" markers from a variety of languages to determine whether they can be viewed as evidentials."
2020,3,17,Polina Nasledskova,Denominal postposition in East Caucasian languages,"This is a study of grammaticalization sources of postpositions across East Caucasian languages. The focus is on the postpositions grammaticalized from nouns denoting body parts. While these nouns cross-linguistically often grammaticalize into spatial markers, in particular adpositions, this path does not seem to be typical of (all) East Caucasian. Postpositions from body parts are not equally spread across the family. Some languages have many, some few, and some none at all. The goal of this study is to provide an account for their distribution in genealogical and areal terms."
2020,3,17,Timofey Mukhin,Anaphora and spatial deixis in East Caucasian: an overview of the data,"Demonstratives, in addition to the main deictic uses, cross-linguistically often acquire a number of other functions, including anaphora. The majority of East Caucasian have rich inventories of demonstrative pronouns that employ three or more different stems covering various dimensions of deixis (distance, altitude and other). Most languages of Dagestan do not have a special 3rd person nominal pronoun and use attributive demonstratives instead. The main goal of my study is to examine what governs the choice of the stem to be used anaphorically (for example only proximal one) or, if all stems of an inventory are used in this function, how are they distributed in this function by frequency. My study is based on grammars and samples of narrative texts. In this presentation, only data from Lezgic languages will be discussed."
2020,3,10,Peter Arkadiev,Non-canonical inverse in Circassian and Abaza: borrowing of morphological complexity,"In this paper I discuss a typologically peculiar inverse-like construction found in the polysynthetic ergative Circassian languages of the Northwest-Caucasian family and will argue that this construction has been borrowed into Abaza belonging to a different branch of the same family. These languages possess a cislocative verbal prefix, which, in addition to marking the spatial meaning of speaker-orientation, systematically occurs in polyvalent verbs when the object outranks the subject on the person hierarchy. The inverse-like use of the cislocative in Circassian differs from the “canonical” direct-inverse system in that, first, it is fully redundant since the person-role linking is achieved by means of the person markers themselves and, second, it does not occur in the basic transitive construction, featuring instead in configurations involving an indirect object both in ditransitive and bivalent intransitive verbs. I argue that the similar use of the cislocative prefix observed in Abaza is a result of pattern-borrowing from Kabardian, with which Abaza has been in intense contact, and that this borrowing has resulted in the increase of both paradigmatic and syntagmatic complexity of Abaza verbal morphology."
2020,3,3,Evgeniya Budennaya,Non-pro-drop in the Baltic Area: for and against contact-induced origin,"Five geographically close languages to the east of the Baltic sea – Russian (East Slavic), Latvian (Baltic), Ingrian, Votic and Ingrian Finnish (Finnic) – use a similar pattern for marking subject reference. In this pattern both personal pronouns and subject agreement on the verb are employed (from ⅔ to ¾ of all occurrences). This happens with all types of personhood: (1) Russian: Ja id-u domoj I.NOM go.PRS-1SG home ‘I go home’ (2) Latvian: par k-o t-u domā-ø ? - about what-ACC 2SG-NOM think.PRS-2SG ‘What are you thinking about?’ (3) Ingrian: hǟ kūl-i-ø 3SG.NOM die-PST-3SG ‘She is dead’ However, this double-marking pattern is extremely uncommon over the world where most languages are either pro-drop with verbal inflection (61%, WALS) or non-pro-drop without any additional verbal inflection (Siewierska 2004). Taken together the geographical proximity of the languages under discussion and the typological rarity of the referential pattern itself, one can treat it as an areal feature which could not arise independently (Kibrik 2013). The talk will trace this feature diachronically and discuss the results for Russian, Latvian and minor Finnic. Special attention will be given to the controversy of whether we deal with a similar contact-induced change in Latvian and minor Finnic or with two different processes that eventually converged into an apparently similar pattern."

Data for this resource are retrieved from grammars and organized into databases which are then used to generate maps. The final product will be a tool for the visualization of information about linguistic structures characteristic of Daghestan, but also a useful resource for bibliographical research on parameters of interest. In this talk we will discuss the state of affairs of the project and our future plans. We will briefly present the preliminary results related to the features that are currently being developed, and we will discuss some technical issues concerning the design of introductory texts and the generation of maps."
2020,2,18,"Maria Morozova, Maria Ovsjannikova, Alexander Rusakov",A dialectometric study of Albanian varieties: linguistic complexity and language contact history,"The goal of our study is to examine the Albanian dialect continuum using the quantitative methods of dialectometry and interpret the results in terms of the history of the Albanian dialect landscape, in particular its contact history. Our data come from the Dialectological Atlas of Albanian Language that maps phonological, morphological and lexical features of 131 Albanian varieties of the main dialectal area. Using distance calculation, MDS analysis and hierarchical clustering, we estimate and visualize the closeness of these varieties and analyse it against their geographical distribution and the traditional classification of Albanian dialects. The main focus of our talk will be on the notion of linguistic complexity as applied to the Albanian dialect continuum. We identify 27 phonological and morphological parameters as binary complexity/simplicity features, examine their realization in the varieties under study and assess the relation between intensity of contact and linguistic complexity. Then we will briefly discuss the distribution of the varieties in terms of 212 lexical features to compare their grammatical and lexical closeness."
2020,2,11,"Natalya Stoynova, Irina Khomchenkova",Contact-influenced Russian of Northern Siberia and the Russian Far East,"We will present a new small corpus of contact-influenced Russian speech, namely the Corpus of Russian spoken in Northern Siberia and the Russian Far East, and several case studies on contact phenomena in grammar, based on its data. The corpus consists of short oral texts, mostly narratives, collected as a “by-product” of language documentation projects (some of them are Russian versions of texts in the corresponding indigenous language). The current size of the corpus is ca. 34 hours (78452 tokens). The majority of texts come from two regions - the Taimyr peninsula (the subcorpus of Samoyedic Russian) and Khabarovsk Krai (the subcorpus of Tungusic Russian). The most important feature of the corpus is the manual annotation of grammatical and lexical contact-induced features. It will be discussed in detail with a focus on problematic cases. To illustrate the range of problems that can be investigated on the data of this corpus, we will also present several case studies. First, we will try to trace a post-pidgin continuum, attested among the Nganasans, on the data of non-standard gender agreement patterns (cf. бабка помер ‘old woman die.pst.masc’). Second, we will consider a problem of identifying morpho-syntactic calques on the example of non-standard numeral constructions, attested in Tungusic Russian (пять дом ‘five house.nom.sg’, двое сыновья ‘two son.nom.pl’). Third, we will illustrate the problem of differentiation between contact-induced and dialectal features on the example of pluperfect be-constructions (умер было ‘(he) died be.pst’) and non-standard coordination patterns with the particle da (офицер=да, майор=да ‘officers=ptcl majors=ptcl’), attested in the speech of the Nanais. Finally, we will discuss some general quantitative data on contact-induced grammatical features attested in the corpus, namely the general frequency distribution of different types of these features and individual profiles, compiled for several speakers."
2020,2,4,"Ezequiel Koile, Konstantin Filatov, Michael Daniel",Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and wordlist handling,"In this talk, present an introduction to modern Bayesian phylogenetic analysis in historical linguistics. Algorithms will be discussed with special focus in its conceptual motivations, as well as its scope and limitations. Wordlist building and handling will be approached from a practical perspective, including recommendations and examples of implementation. Cross-linguistic online resources and edition tools for this task will be presented. At the end of the seminar, in a separate bonus track we will introduce you to the ongoing collection of 100 Swadesh lists in Daghestan. Our approach emphasizes the importance of strict provenance of the list (village of collection) and the importance of the protocol for data collection (contextualization of the lexical items). If we have time, we will show the preliminary results of the project - the tree of the Andic branch as based on our data."
2020,1,28,Ilya Yakubovich (Russian Academy of Sciences / University of Marburg),Correlates of Language Shift in Population Groups vs. Epigraphic Cultures,"The scholars focusing on sociolinguistic situations in ancient societies have no direct access to information about the boundaries of language communities at given points in time but have to study them through the prism of the available written sources. Since the notion of language shift is equally applicable to population groups and epigraphic cultures, and since it can be accompanied by contact-induced changes in both cases, it is appropriate to ask a question how the difference between the two types of communities correlates with different manifestations of language contact. Both corpora of spoken languages and archaic written texts commonly feature results of lexical transfer (borrowings) as well as structural interference. They seem, however, to exhibit inverse chronological correlation between the two types of contact-induced changes and the moment of language shift. When language contact is observed among population groups, lexical expansion frequently predates the shift to a new native language, while structural changes continue to reflect substrate influence after the act of language shift has taken place. In contrast, in the instance of archaic epigraphic cultures (e.g. hieroglyphs or the cuneiform), late or peripheral texts in a particular language frequently reveal deviations in grammatical structure, while written language shift in a scribal community may be accompanied by the retention of graphic loanwords (heterograms), which represent the language of tradition. In my talk I intend to address the reasons for such an asymmetry, and to discuss the peculiarities of some contact situations that do not fall under the proposed generalization."
2020,1,21,"Nina Dobrushina, George Moroz",The speakers of minority languages are more multilingual,"Population size is often discussed as a factor which might have influenced patterns of language and cultural evolution (Bowern 2010; Donohue & Nichols 2011; Nettle 2012; Bromham et al. 2015; Greenhill et al. 2018; Koplenig 2019; see Greenhill 2014 for an overview). In this paper, we advance the hypothesis that the larger is the population of language speakers, the less is the number of L2 mastered by these speakers. The correlation between the size of language population and the level of multilingualism of its speakers is tested statistically on a large body of empirical data from Dagestan. Due to the digitalization of the Census of 1926, we have at our disposal reliable information about the population of Dagestanian villages before the urbanization and the rise of population caused by the First Demographic Transition. These data allow us to make credible estimations of the number of speakers of all languages and dialects of Dagestan before the changes of 20th century. The second type of data comes from a field study of Dagestanian multilingualism. Language repertoires of 4,032 people were collected and coded by using the method of retrospective family interviews during field research in 2011 - 2019. The data on multilingual repertoires covers only a small part of the villages for which we have population sizes, namely 54 villages speaking 29 different lects. We match population sizes of these 29 languages and the number of L2s spoken by the speakers of these languages from 54 villages, and run a Poisson mixed effects regression model that predicts the average number of second languages spoken by speakers from L1 communities of different size. The study confirms the hypothesis that the size of language population is negatively correlated with the multilingualism of the language community."
2020,1,14,Aigul Zakirova,The particle =OK in the Volga-Kama languages: contexts of use and frequencies of lexicalization,"In this talk I will focus on the emphatic identity particle in the Volga-Kama languages (Chuvash =aχ/ =eχ, Tatar and Bashkir =uk/ =ük, Meadow Mari =ak, Hill Mari =ok and Udmurt =ik). The particle was borrowed from the Turkic (Bulgar) lects to the Finno-Ugric lects of the Sprachbund. Its contexts of use overlap to a fair extent in different languages but do not fully coincide. One of the core functions is that =OK is used when an argument of a proposition is identical to an argument of a different proposition (e.g. that house=OK 'the same house', referring to a previously mentioned house). In this talk I will take a closer look at this and other contexts of use of =OK in the languages of the area. Besides, =OK tends to attach and become lexicalized with some items, mostly adverbial expressions. I will present data on the frequencies of such collocations with =OK in the Volga-Kama Sprachbund."
2019,12,24,Konstantin Kazenin,"Ethnicity, speaking indigenous languages and fertility in the North Caucasus","Regions of the North Caucasus have experienced considerable social changes within the recent 4-5 decades, which included intensive urbanization, loosening of traditional family norms, weakening of gender asymmetries and lowering of empowerment of elder generations in communities and families. These processes started at different time and went with different speed in the republics of the North Caucasus, but in all the republics they were accompanied by a significant decrease of fertility, known as the First Demographic Transition (FDT) in population studies. That decrease was not at all unexpected, as ‘detraditionalization’ changes of the kind recently observed in the North Caucasus and the First Demographic Transition took place nearly simultaneously in many parts of the world. However, a number of cultural characteristics of the North Caucasus allows to address some issues concerning the First Demographic Transition which are difficult to consider elsewhere. First, at the start of the social and demographic changes women of different ethnicities differed in their fertility levels. As urbanization made interethnic contacts more intensive, the question arises whether these differences were eliminated in the process of the fertility decrease. Second, in urban population of the North Caucasus, including younger generations, the proportion of speaking indigenous languages is not negligible. Therefore, it is possible to consider the hypothesis that in families where an indigenous language is spoken in everyday life fertility will not decrease so radically as in families where Russian is the only spoken language of the parents. If this expectation is borne out, we get an interesting case where linguistic and reproductive behavior are related. The talk will start with introducing the concept of the First Demographic Transition. Then we present the key demographic changes observed in the North Caucasus between the 1970s and the 2010s. After that, using data from the Republic of Daghestan (Russian Census 2010 and a sample survey of 2018), we demonstrate that ethnic differences in fertility were preserved to different extent in different educational groups of urban population. Also, using data from the Republics of Ingushetia (a sample survey of 2019), we show that parents’ speaking an indigenous language really has a positive significant relation to fertility."
2019,12,17,Paul Phelan,The periphrastic causative in West Circassian,"West Circassian, along with the other languages of the Northwest Caucasian family, is a highly polysynthetic language with complex verbal morphology. One marker in particular, the causative marker ʁe- , is highly productive. The morphological causative is commonly used to derive transitive predicates from nontransitive verbs and nominals. It is also, clearly, an important instrument for expressing the semantics of causation and in the associated valency increasing operation. In some cases ʁe- has even calcified on predicates, so that the predicate has no meaning without the causative prefix. It is therefore rather remarkable that a periphrastic causative strategy has arisen in West Circassian. This construction is based on the matrix verb ṣ̂ə- 'to do, make', which pairs with a lexical verb with the purposive suffixation. Based on observations of the behavior of personal indexes on the matrix verb it is apparent that this structure is noncompositional and has grammaticalized with causative semantics which are the same as those of the morphological causative."

The comparative study of colexifications across languages allows for the construction of semantic maps, a useful tool for the study of lexical typology and beyond, ranging from studies on semantic change, patterns of conceptualization, and linguistic paleontology. In this talk, we describe the recently released third version of the Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications, CLICS³ https://clics.clld.org/ (Rzymski, Tresoldi, et al. 2019), a computer-assisted framework for the interactive representation of cross-linguistic colexification patterns, containing data for 2811 concepts across 2955 languages."
2019,11,26,Nina Dobrushina,Challenges of variation,"Variation is inherent to all languages. Ɨt seems, however, that the degree of variation can vary from language to language. It is sometimes claimed that languages with writing systems show more variation than unwritten languages. It was also argued that small languages have less variation than large languages with many L2 speakers. It seems, however, that none of these conjectures were ever empirically tested. In fact, to date we have no methods which would allow measuring and comparing the amount of variation between languages. In this talk I want to raise this problem rather than suggest a solution."

In the present investigation we studied the degree of variation among 44 speakers of Zilo Andi for 16 different morpho(no)logical features known to be variable in this dialect. Additionally, we conducted a survey among a number of researchers of Nakh-Daghestanian languages, asking them about their fieldwork habits - including questions about how many speakers they usually consult. We used these data to evaluate the probability that an average researcher of Nakh-Daghestanian languages catches the observed variation during fieldwork."

Through a series of linguistic maps based on published ethnographic data and our fieldwork accounts, we reconstruct the territories in which Forest Enets and Tundra Enets (Samoyedic, Uralic; Central Siberia) have been spoken from the 17th century till today. We analyze in details migrations of the two ethnic groups and the changing language contact scenarios. One of the most intriguing findings of this study is an explanation of the Forest Enets - Tundra Enets puzzle. There is no unanimity whether they are separate languages or dialects of the same language. Ethnographically, the two linguistic communities are clearly distinct, have different self-nominations, and do not consider themselves as belonging to the same ethnic group. As our field experience has shown, the degree of modern mutual comprehension is not a neutral question and depends on the stance that a speaker takes at the moment of conversation, whether stressing the difference between the two ethnic groups or aiming at reaching his/her communicative goal. Whereas the phonologies of Forest Enets and Tundra Enets suggest a split of at least several hundred years ago, and lexicostatistical calculations go even further by dating the split ca. one thousand years ago, the match between the two Enets grammars is so striking that it contradicts this scenario. So here the linguistic geography steps in, documenting migrations that led to a secondary convergence in the 19th century of the once more distinct Enets lects, which was later, in the beginning of the 20th century, followed by a secondary divergence. We support this historic hypothesis with a catalogue of all features that separate the two Enets varieties and with linguistic maps reconstructing changes in the territories of the two ethnic groups in the last 300 years.

2019,10,29,Natalya Serdobolskaya,Morphosyntax of complement clauses in East Caucasian languages: long-distance agreement,"The East-Caucasian languages (Nakh-Daghestanian) show a number of puzzling structures that are challenging from the theoretical point of view: non-finite clauses where all the arguments are encoded in the same way as in independent sentences, backward control, long-distance reflexive pronouns and long-distance agreement in complement clauses. This talk is focused on long-distance agreement in East Caucasian languages. First, I discuss the phenomenon in Qunqi Dargwa. The infinitives and converbs are the only complementation strategies that allow long-distance agreement. In Qunqi, there is a fuzzy boundary between infinitives and indirect mood forms. The converbs are used both with control verbs and with emotive and perception complement-taking verbs. The long-distance agreement pattern is only observed with control verbs. I show that these structures show properties of clause union. Then I consider the data of 19 East-Caucasian languages (mostly based on the data from Kibrik 2005 ""Materials to the typology of ergativity""), and discuss the long-distance agreement patterns in those languages. In most of these languages this phenomenon is limited to control constructions, while Tsez and Tsakhur deviate from this generalization."
2019,10,22,Albert Davletshin,"Subgroups, linkages and beyond: Working on shared innovations in Eastern Polynesian languages","Polynesia covers a vast territory of the planet. It includes a large number of speech communities which descend from a common ancestor; some them are isolated by thousands of miles of open ocean. No wonder, Polynesia has always been the favorite place for both linguists and anthropologists working on phylogenetics. The standard account of the Eastern Polynesian subgrouping is that the language of Easter Island (Rapanui) forms a branch on its own, coordinated with Central Polynesian languages; CE in turns branches into Tahitic and Marquesic (Roger 1985). It has been becoming more and more evident that Tahitic and Marquesic are not valid subgroups (Vladimir Belikov 2009, Mary Walworth 2014). In my talk, I am going to show that Rapanui, Mangarevan, North and South Marquesan constitute a subgroup within Eastern Polynesian languages. Interestingly enough, this proposal implies some phonological and lexical innovations spreading across the Pacific. The main objective of the talk is to discuss the latter and their implications for the theory of language."
2019,10,15,"Alexander Shiryaev, Michael Daniel, George Moroz",Glottalized /lˀ/ in Rikvani Andi,"The opposition of the geminate and singleton ejective lateral stop /L'/, reconstructed to proto-Andic, has been lost in various Andic languages due to the phonetic evolution of the simpleton into a different soundtype. The speakers of Rikvani Andi, a dialect of Andi (Andic, East Caucasian) spoken by 800 people in the village of Rikvani in Dagestan, developed a glottalized lateral consonant as a reflex. Glottalized sonorants are a typological rara. While they have been sparsely attested in various areas where glottalic initiation also occurs with stops (ejectives), Rikvani Andi is the only variety of a Caucasian language where it has so far been reported. The present study is an acoustic analysis of the sound as documented in the field data collected by the HSE team in the village. Data from six speakers's word list elicitation as well as from spontaneous texts from two speakers are used. This study is the first that considers glottalized sonorants in connected free speech. We test several generalizations and observations previously made wrt glottalized sonorants (Um 2001, Maddieson and Larson 2002, Maddieson et al. 2009). We confirm presence of strong variation of the realization of the glottliazed /lˀ/ across speakers in terms of presence of creaky voice, focus of glottalization, intensiity and formant structure. We do not confirm Um's suggestion that the peak of glottal construction (pre- vs. post-glottalized realization) is affected by the poisition of the sound in syllable/word. We conclude that the distinctive feature is the presence of creaky voice and intensity, but these features become less pronounced in free speech. Finding the acoustic cue that serves to distinguish glottalized sonorant requires further acoustic research. Variation across speakers and fading away of the cues in connected speech may suggest that a merger of /lˀ/ and /l/ is on its way. Various visualization techniques highlighting the nature of /lˀ/ will be discussed."

2019,9,24,Ezequiel Koile,Phylogeography of the Bantu Expansion,"Bantu expansion is among the most important and least understood human migrations. Bantu-speaking populations (240 million people, 500 languages, spanning 9 million km2 [1]) are the result of a huge migration originating in a homeland near the border of Nigeria and Cameroon between 4,000BP and 5,000BP [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Although the homeland and the time depth are well established, the migration route is still unclear. Recent phylogenetic studies [1,9,6,7,8] support the late-split [10,11,12,13,14], which claims that East-Bantu and West-Bantu languages' common ancestor crossed the African Rainforest, splitting after this. It is thought that this crossing was made through the Sangha River Interval (SRI), a N-S savanna opening into the rainforest. However, in dated phylogenies [7], dates don't match consistently: They should have crossed this corridor around 4,000BP, while it was completely open only 2,500BP. We propose two different hypotheses for competing with the traditional SRI late-split. The first, a coastal savanna corridor [15]. The second, an earlier paath through the rainforest. We compare the hypotheses with a Bayesian phylogeographic approach based on linguistic trees. We use lexical and geographical data for 400+ Bantu and Bantoid languages, inferring the linguistic and geographic history in parallel, by implementing the break-away model [16] in BEAST2 [17]. We conclude that the way through the rainforest happened around 4,000BP."
2019,9,24,"Chiara Naccarato, Natalya Stoynova, Anastasia Panova",Contact-influenced word order in genitive noun phrases: A corpus-based investigation of Russian spoken in Daghestan,"The paper deals with non-standard word order in the variety of Russian spoken by bilinguals from Daghestan. Specifically, we focus on the occurrence of prepositive genitive modifiers in bilinguals’ speech. Whereas in monolinguals’ Russian the neutral and most frequent word order in noun phrases with a genitive modifier is the order N+GEN, in Daghestanian Russian the opposite order GEN+N often occurs. This phenomenon was mentioned as one of the striking morphosyntactic features of Daghestanian Russian, and its frequent occurrence can be partly explained in terms of syntactic calquing from speakers’ L1s, all featuring an unmarked GEN+N order in noun phrases. However, the picture is far less trivial than it could look at first sight. On the one hand, the word-order pattern GEN+N does not seem to affect equally all types of genitive noun phrases in Daghestanian Russian. On the other hand, similar examples of non-standard word order are sometimes found in monolinguals’ speech too. In the course of the paper, we present the results of our corpus-based investigation of genitive noun phrases in Daghestanian Russian as compared to monolinguals’ spoken Russian, including dialectal varieties. Prepositive genitives appear to be favored by several lexico-semantic and processing features of both the head and the genitive dependent. The strongest factor is kinship semantics: noun phrases that express a kinship relation tend to be prepositive. In monolinguals’ spoken Russian, although prepositive genitives are very infrequent, they sometimes show similar lexico-semantic and processing features. Therefore, we are not dealing with a simple calquing process. Rather, L1 influence is manifested in the strengthening of some tendencies existing in monolinguals’ Russian too."
2019,9,17,"Michael Daniel, Ilya Chechuro, Samira Verhees, Nina Dobrushina",Lingua francas as lexical donors: quantitative field study,"The paper investigates the role that the rate of bilingualism plays in lexical borrowing. Our data comes from Daghestan, an area of high language density. Based on loanword counts, we isolate two zones of lexical influence, the south, heavily influenced by Azerbaijani, and the north, dominated by Avar. This salience of Avar and Azerbaijani as donor languages is likely to reflect the historical role of these languages as lingua francas in their respective geographical zones. The study supports the idea of Brown (1996, 2011) that contact influence from a lingua franca is higher than from a language only used to communicate with its L1 speakers. In line with the widespread argument that the amount of contact-induced change from a language is proportional to intensity of bilingualism (Thomason & Kaufman 1988), Brown stipulates that the importance of lingua francas as lexical donors must be linked to the high rate of bilingualism in these languages. The bilingualism in Azerbaijani and Avar was indeed high, as the evidence from field research on traditional language repertoires of Daghestanian highlanders shows. On the other hand, the knowledge of two other locally important languages, Chechen and Georgian, which was, at some locations, only slightly lower, did not lead to the same level of lexical transfer; in fact, the amount of Georgian and Chechen borrowings seems disproportionately low. High bilingualism rates are thus not sufficient for a language to become a major lexical donor. At the level of methodology, the paper explores the prospects of using short wordlists as ‘contact probes’, tools for measuring lexical contact. We follow the approach by Haspelmath & Tadmor (2009) and Bowern et al. (2011) in applying a fixed list of concept to quantify lexical contact between languages. Based on field elicitations conducted in a number of villages in the Republic of Daghestan, a list of 160 concepts is shown to be efficient enough to differentiate the degrees of lexical impact from the locally important L2’s to minority languages. The method does not only ensure comparability across contact situations but also provides a level of resolution that is sensitive to differences between villages speaking the same language. By fine-tuning the wordlist to a different linguistic setting, the methodology suggested here may be extended to other geographical areas of intense language contact and become a tool for reconstructing multilingual patterns of the past."
2019,6,11,"Chiara Naccarato, Natalya Stoynova, Anastasia Panova",Contact-influenced word order in genitive noun phrases: A corpus-based investigation of Russian spoken in Daghestan,"In a recent paper (Naccarato, Panova & Stoynova Forth.), we have examined cases of non-standard word order in the variety of Russian spoken by bilinguals from Daghestan. Specifically, we have restricted our analysis to the noun phrase, and have looked at the occurrence of prepositive genitive modifiers in bilinguals’ speech. As we have shown, whereas in Standard Russian the neutral and most frequent word order in noun phrases with a genitive modifier is the order N+GEN (muž sestry), in Daghestanian Russian the opposite order GEN+N (sestry muž) often occurs. This phenomenon has been partly explained in terms of syntactic calquing from speakers’ L1s, all featuring a neutral GEN+N order in noun phrases. However, such inversion in word order does not seem to equally affect all types of genitive noun phrases in Daghestanian Russian, but appears to correlate significantly with noun phrases featuring kinship semantics. Moreover, similar examples of non-standard word order are sometimes found in monolinguals’ speech too, which makes the picture far less trivial than it could look at first sight. In this talk, we present the latest results of our corpus-based investigation of genitive noun phrases in Daghestanian Russian as compared to monolinguals’ spoken varieties of Russian, with the aim of explaining the factors boosting non-standard word-order realizations."
2019,6,4,"Samira Verhees, Chiara Naccarato",Animacy agreement in Botlikh: ordinal numeral,"Botlikh (Avar-Andic, East Caucasian) features a two-fold animacy agreement system including, on the one hand, a set of noun class (i.e. gender) markers representative of many EC languages and, on the other hand, an additional set of dedicated animacy markers which are unique to Botlikh. The dedicated animacy markers can appear on various targets (i.e. negative copulas, interrogative particles, question word formants, attributive clitics, present/future participles, ordinal numerals), and agreement is controlled by either the nominal head or the absolutive argument of the verb. By focusing on ordinal numerals, which appear to mark animacy most consistently, we set the following goals: a) to better understand the agreement patterns of these forms; b) to clarify which referents qualify as animates and which do not. For these purposes, we have created the first draft of a survey which we will discuss during the talk."

The Lowland Amazon is an area of extreme linguistic diversity, where geographic proximity and language contact has resulted in unprecedented diffusion of patterns and forms (Aikhenvald 2002). The area between the Caquetá and Putumayo (hereafter referred to as ‘C-P’) River Basins, spanning southern parts of Colombia and northern Peru, is loosely defined in the literature as the ‘People of the Centre cultural complex’ (Echeverri 1997). It consists of eight dispersed ethnolinguistic groups that belong to three distinct language families (Witotoan, Boran, and Arawak), plus one isolate, Andoque. Traditionally, the groups lived next to each other, and displayed relative cultural homogeneity, such as trade of goods, common ritual activities, intermarriage, and multilingualism (Eriksen 2011, Seifart 2015). The C-P languages also share a daunting number of linguistic traits, including nominal classification. In this talk, we will see how the categories of evidentiality and epistemic modality are expressed across the C-P languages, and what it tells us about language contact and change in Northwest Amazonia.

While the prefix u- has an ablative meaning, as shown when it is prefixed to motion verbs, the prepositional phrase u+gen occurs in locative constructions, and other related constructions, such as predicative possession that is expressed via the cross-linguistically common Locative Schema. Etymological considerations show that the meaning preserved by the prefix is older. The only type of occurrence which, according to the literature, preserves the ablative meaning for the u+gen construction preposition is found with verbs of requesting, removing, and buying. Notably, however, in other Slavic languages putative ablative contexts are limited to verbs of requesting. Data from MSR, OCS, Polish and Czech lead to the conclusion that the extension of the u+gen construction to verbs of removing in MSR is based on its use for the encoding of predicative possession. Extension to verbs of buying is better explained through the locative meaning of the construction. As a result of different developments, the u+gen construction has become part of the argument structure of a group of verbs including verbs of asking and requesting, verbs of removing and verbs of buying, which are characterized by the common feature of taking human non-recipient third arguments."

2019,1,15,Ekaterina Schnittke,Sequence of tenses in Russian? Tense choice in complement clauses in Standard and Learner Russian,"It is generally believed that Russian has no sequence of tenses (SoT) in complement clauses, and the choice of absolute tense over relative is considered to be a typical error in the interlanguage of non-standard speakers of Russian as a foreign language whose native language features SoT, e.g. English. However, all uses of absolute tense in Learner Russian cannot qualify as errors, since Standard Russian shows a great deal of variation in tense assignment in complement clauses. One of the factors that is said to govern tense choice is the semantics of the matrix verb (Barentsen, 1996; Гиро-Вебер, 1975, Schlenker, 2003, inter alia). Specifically, speech and mental verbs are said to strictly require the relative tense, whereas sensory, emotion, and existential matrix verbs allow for both absolute and relative tense patterns. Despite the acknowledged variation, the precise distributional patterns of tenses in complement clauses have been understudied. This paper is a systematic corpus-based study of the variation in tense choice across the semantic classes of the matrix verbs in two language varieties: (i) Standard Russian as represented in the Russian National Corpus and (ii) Learner Russian of anglophone speakers as represented in the Russian Learner Corpus. I examine those clausal complexes where the matrix verb in the past tense and the verb of the complement clause denote simultaneous actions. The analysis identified a likelihood hierarchy of verbal semantic classes ranging from the least likely to tolerate past tense in the complement clauses to the most likely ones: speech<mental<sensory≈emotion"

2018,12,4,"Timur Maisak, Michael Daniel, Yury Lander",Corpus research of target relativization in several languages of the Caucausus,"In this talk, we will discuss modifying participial constructions which is a predominant type of relative clauses in East Caucasian languages. One of the key properties of participles in East Caucasian languages is the lack of syntactic orientation. There is little to no syntactic restrictions on what can be relativized: the gap in the relative clause can correspond to a core argument, a peripheral participant or even a participant that is not part of the verb’s argument structure. Languages also share some common patterns of constructionalization of specififc relative construction (such as name-constructions). On the other hand, there is variation across languages, e.g. more or less strongly articulated preference for S relativization; or more or less widespread use of the resumptives; and language-particular features, e.g. a very high ratio of addresse relativization (in name-constructions) in Agul. After a general overview of the problems related to the study of relativization targets, we concentrate on language-particular case studies and discuss the counts of relativization targets in the corpora of two East Caucasian languages (Agul and Archi). As a comparative background, West Circassian corpus data will be presented. In this language relativization is syntactically oriented, the strategy cannot be classified as participial, and special reflexivizers may be interpreted as obligatorified resumptive pronouns. Finally, we discuss the comparison of corpus counts on the relativized syntactic role in the three languages, and the problems connected to such comparison."

Some contexts of their use may be qualified as denoting unrealized state-of-affairs (such as conditional clauses, polar questions, and, to a certain extent, indefinite pronouns). Some others fall short of this definition, including indirect questions and other subordinate clauses with WH-words. The set of contexts covered by the markers in question is one and the same in at least three Lezgic languages (Lezgian, Aghul, Tabassaran), and also in Azerbaijani, which raises a question of possible contact origin of this pattern. Some other Lezgic languages employ, in these contexts, several different markers. Kina dialect of Rutul presents an especially interesting case, combining in one morpheme (-jden) the meanings which are unlikely to be associated. In this talk, I will present the case of Kina Rutul in details, discuss possible interpretation and origins of the marker -jden, and compare Kina Rutul with other Lezgic languages."
2018,11,6,Michael Daniel,Evaluating DP as a measure of corpus heterogeneity. The Even dialect comparison project at crossroads,"In this SMALL discussion, we will present the path taken so far for the methods of inter-dialectal comparison, the point we are currently standing (or stuck) at, and will gratefully take advices as to how to proceed. We will first remind of the starting point of the project, ie a mehod of isolating inter-dialectal divergence that takes into account inter-speaker variation. Than we will briefly overview the steps we did so far (LogLikelihood, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, Gries' DP). We will then focus on the very last result we got, evaluating the observed DP value against the simluation and permutation test for the distribution of the DP in a random sample - and whether we can use it for our purposes."
2018,10,30,Aigul Zakirova,The emphatic identity particle =OK in the Volga-Kama Sprachbund,"The particle =OK, originally Turkic, is attested in all the core members of the Volga-Kama Sprachbund: Chuvash =aχ/ =eχ, Tatar and Bashkir =uk/ =ük, Meadow Mari =ak, Hill Mari =ok and Udmurt =ik. Meadow Mari, Hill Mari and Udmurt have arguably borrowed the particle from Turkic (Bulgar). =OK is used in contexts many of which may be characterized as emphatic identity contexts: the argument marked by =OK is the same as an argument of a different proposition (≈ Russian že: Masha rabotajet v pole, Masha že sidit s det'mi 'Mary works in the field and it is also she who sits with the children'). However, in different languages =OK exhibits different morphosyntactic restrictions on the constituent to which it may attach, i.e. in Tatar it attaches to demonstratives (šul uk keše 'the same person') but not to proper names (*Märijäm ük 'it is also Mary who...'). In Chuvash, Meadow and Hill Mari and Udmurt the particle can attach to proper names. =OK can also attach to the verb, with different interpretations and again with different morphosyntactic restrictions. There are similar constructions and lexicalizations with =OK in some of the languages (e.g. reduplication construction of the type V-converb=OK V). I would like to discuss whether -- and how -- we can approach these similar patterns in terms of contact. From the literature we know what were the strongest bonds in the area (Chuvash-Mari, Tatar-Meadow Mari, Tatar-Bashkir). The question is whether greater and weaker similarity of =OK morphosyntactic, construction and lexicalization patterns between languages corresponds to areal affinity and how to demonstrate it."

2018,10,16,Tanya Filippova,Фразовые компаративы: ограничения на объект сравнения,"Доклад будет посвящен исследованию определенного типа сравнительных конструкций, которые я буду называть фразовыми компаративами (phrasal comparatives). Примерами таких конструкций в русском языке являются: *Ваня выше Пети*; *Ваня прыгает выше Пети*; *Ваня ценит Петю больше Коли* и т.д, то есть конструкции, в которых стандарт сравнения всегда выражен именной группой в родительном падеже.

Я рассмотрю ограничения на объект сравнения в конструкциях с переходными глаголами, таких как *Ваня ценит Петю больше Коли*. Подобные предложения потенциально имеют 2 прочтения: 1) стандарт сравнения противопоставлен подлежащему (объект сравнения = подлежащее); 2) стандарт сравнения противопоставлен дополнению (объект сравнения = дополнение). Мы посмотрим, как порядок слов и маркирование именной группы частицами только и даже влияют на интерпретацию таких предложений.

Мы также рассмотрим фразовые компаративы в некоторых других языках, и я предложу предварительный общий анализ ограничений на объект сравнения в рамках теории информационной структуры.

Наконец, я представлю план большого опросника для носителей русского языка, призванный установить, при каких условиях одна из интерпретаций фразового компаратива является просто предпочтительной и при каких – единственно допустимой."
2018,10,9,Alexey Koshevoy,Validity of the data collected indirectly: belated proof of concept,"Within the framework of Multidagestan project, vast amount of sociolinguistic data about traditional small-scale multilingualism was collected in Daghestan. The aim of the project is to trace the change of the multilingual patterns in the 20th century. However, 71 percent of the data were collected in an indirect way, asking people about their relatives. We will discuss the statistical methods that we used to check the robustness of the indirectly collected sociolinguistic data."
2017,11,21,"Timur Maisak, Anastasia Panova",Corpus of Russian spoken in Daghestan,"The corpus of regional variants of Russian spoken in Daghestan is based on transcribed sociolinguistic interviews in Russian with speakers of various Daghestanian languages ​​who live in rural areas. Technically, the corpus is built using the platform and annotation principles developed for the dialectal corpus of Ustja River Basin. The aims of the project include both its maintenance and adding new texts, as well as the use of the corpus for systematic study of morphosyntactic characteristics of Daghestanian Russian. In the talk, we plan to discuss the current state of the corpus, the possibilities of corpus-based research, as well as the problems we met and the perspectives of the project."
2017,11,14,"Olga Lyashevskaya, Ilya Chechuro",Prosodic Analysis of Non-standard Russian Spontaneous Speech,"The study deals with the intonation patterns in three Non-Standard varieties of Russian. In the first part of the talk we discuss the methodological issues, such as analysis of pitch range, data filtering and data representation. In the second part, we consider a number of case studies, namely Daghestanian Russian, Southern Russian and Jewish Russian. The general goal of the project is to compile an annotated corpus of non-standard Russian with pitch annotation and explore the intonation patterns of non-standard varieties of Russian basing on corpus data."

During the presentation, we are going to talk about phonetic and sociolinguistic features of different Circassian idioms, present a project of an atlas of Circassian isoglosses and show first maps, which the atlas will include. In addition, we will describe the process of creating a phonetic and grammatical questionnaire and the difficulties associated with that."
2017,10,26,"Vasilisa Andriyanets, Brigitte Pakendorf",Dialectal Variation in Even based on Corpora of Field Recordings,"The talk presents the ""Dialectal variation in Even"" project. The project works with two dialects of Even: the easternmost one spoken in the village Sebjan-Küöl in Yakutia and the westernmost one spoken in Kamchatka. The first dialect has been in contact with Yakut for a long time, while the second has possibly been in contact with Koryak and Itelmen. The aim of the project is to discover differences between the two dialects and whether they stem from independent innovations or contact. For this, we use corpora of field recordings collected by Brigitta Pakendorf in the course of 2007-2012. In this talk we will describe the data, argue what differences can be found in them and what statistical methods can be used for this, and present some differences in morphology and syntax that have been found so far."
2017,10,19,"Alexandra Kozhukhar, Olga Lyashevskaya",Universal Dependencies for Mehweb Dargwa,"The Universal Dependencies (UD) is a project dealing with consistent cross-linguistic morphological and syntactic mark-up. The UD is currently in version 2 and covers 52 languages with 10 more languages yet to be included. With its own annotation principles and abstract inventory for parts of speech, morphosyntactic features and dependency relations, UD aims to facilitate multilingual parser development, crosslingual learning, and parsing research from a language typology perspective. While UD covers 11 language families, it does not include any languages of the Caucasus (including the East Caucasian family). In our talk we will describe the way Mehweb Dargwa (East Caucasian) meets the UD scheme."
2017,10,10,"Anna Volkova, Michael Voronov","Spoken Meadow Mari corpus: data, design, and aims","The talk presents the Spoken Meadow Mari corpus project. Meadow Mari is a Uralic language spoken in the Volga region by some 375 thousand people. The core of the corpus are recordings made in 2000-2001 by a group of researchers from the Lomonosov Moscow State University. In our talk we will discuss the data we have, possible applications of the project and the target audiences of the corpus, as well as its structure. Making the corpus data presentable involves transcribing, glossing and annotating the data as well as aligning audio and text which should facilitate data analysis."
2017,10,3,"Sven Grawunder, Michael Daniel, Vasilisa Zhigulskaya, George Moroz",Daghestanian Stops,"Rich consonantal inventories are a salient feature of the languages of the Caucasus on the whole and of the languages of Daghestan in particular. Their composition is a subject to a certain variation from language to language, but is overall similar. All languages have ejectives, most languages have labialization, and geminates are not uncommon. On the other hand, acoustic properties of the phonologically identical elements may be substantially different. To document these differences, in the last few years we do systematic field recordings of data from different languages. In this talk we will introduce the aims and methods of the project and will present preliminary results of our analysis of acoustic properties of ejectives as compared to corresponding voiceless stops. We will evaluate the impact of such parameters as closure duration and voice onset time. We will use the data from three different languages - Rutul (Kina dialect), Andi (Zilo dialect) and Mehweb. In the long run, we hope that our project will be able to address the following theoretical question: is the observed intragenetic variation more sensitive to areal or to systemic factors?"
2017,9,26,"Nina Dobrushina, Alexandra Kozhukhar",Daghestanian Multilingualism,"The project ""Atlas of Multilingualism of Daghestan"" is based on sociolinguistic interviews recorded in Daghestan by the team of this project over the course of seven years. The aim of the project is to determine the level of bilingualism in Daghestanian mountain villages and describe the sociolinguistic patterns of linguistic convergence of local languages. In addition, the project allows to establish the type of linguistic contact characteristic of neighboring villages, which languages not pertaining to a particular area were spoken by inhabitants, how the command of Russian changed, what role the geographic distance between languages played and how the command of certain languages was distributed among inhabitants of a village. This talk will focus on two topics: first of all, we will show the results of a study of how the command of languages was distributed among men and women and how these dynamics have evolved since the beginning of the 20th century until now. Second, we will discuss some problems and shortcomings of the method used and we will suggest some verification methods."
2017,9,19,"Michael Daniel, Samira Verhees, Ilya Chechuro",Daghestanian Loans,"The DagLoans project aims at investigating lexical convergence between East Caucasian languages and their neighbours in quantitative terms. We focus on horizontal interaction, looking at borrowings between languages that are in direct contact and dismissing influence of dominant cultures and distant languages, e.g. Arabic, Persian or Russian. The project consists of two parts - one dealing with lexical matter copy, the other with lexical pattern copy. Today we are only discussing the data of the former. We deal with lexical matter borrowing in an attempt to compare and quantify horizontal borrowing between languages at different locations. Instead of comparing standard languages, we aim at comparing local varieties and, ideally, village lects. Basing on the Leipzig-Jakarta list and issues of ""Отраслевая лексика"", we attempt to compose a list of lexical items with a high borrowability rate. The list should be concise enough to be elicited from several speakers during a one day visit to a village, but, on the other hand, long enough to discriminate local varieties and, ideally, village lects. At present, we work on data from Rutul, Tsunta and Botlikh districts. In the talk on September, 19 we plan to discuss the list and its composition and elicitation techniques we use to decide whether it is an adequate tool for studying lexical contact rate at local level and how it reflects local geography and data on bilingualism. The talk is based on the data from 6 villages (4 languages) of the Rutul region that are located in the same valley: Khlut (Lezgian), Kiche (Rutul), Rutul (Rutul), Kina (Rutul), Helmets (Tsakhur), and Kusur (Avar).
